{"test49": {"documents": ["\n(Packaged in cans by Sierra Nevada, and draught from amazing brewers across the country. Available late December!)\nWhen the Camp Fire started in the hills above our Chico brewery on November 8, 2018, it soon became the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history. The fire burned more than 153,000 acres, killed at least 85 people, and destroyed more than 13,000 homes. Many of our employees and community members were severely impacted by this tragic event.\nIn the days following the fire, we announced plans to brew Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, a fundraiser beer for Camp Fire relief. We committed to brewing the beer and donating 100% of the sales to the Sierra Nevada Camp Fire Relief Fund, aimed at long-term community rebuilding support. And we asked every brewery in the country to do it with us.\nWe sent out the \"bat signal\" calling our friends in the industry, asking our suppliers to donate ingredients, asking other breweries (our competitors) to donate their time and labor costs, and asking our wholesalers and retailers to carry the beer for free. It was a big ask, and we never could have anticipated the response.\nMore than 1,400 breweries signed up to brew Resilience. Our suppliers donated ingredients to every brewery nationwide. Wholesalers and retailers agreed to carry the beer and donate every dollar they received. All of them agreed to do this for free to benefit people they had never met.\nIn all, Resilience Butte County Proud IPA should hit the market in mid-late December more than 17,000 barrels-or 4.2 million pints-strong. Every dollar Sierra Nevada receives will go to those impacted by the Camp Fire.\nThank you to the brewing community. Thank you to our suppliers. Thank you to our wholesalers and retailers. And thank you to every single customer who is helping us rebuild our Butte County community-one pint at a time.\nBrewers | Malt Suppliers | Hop Suppliers | Wholesalers\nResilience Night\nWhen: December 20th\nWhere: Your favorite participating brewery\nPlease join us for Resilience Night! On Thursday, December 20, we'll raise a glass with the 1,400+ breweries around the world brewing Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, our fundraiser beer for Camp Fire relief. Head to your local participating brewery to try their version of Resilience IPA-every dollar spent on Resilience will benefit those impacted by the Camp Fire. Together, we can raise more than $10 million to rebuild Butte County.\nUntappd\nWe are excited to announce that, starting December 15th, Untappd is participating in the release of Resilience IPA by offering its users a limited edition badge that can be earned by checking in to ANY Resilience IPA FROM ANY of the breweries that are officially participating. Not an Untappd user? Join today!\nWhere to get Resilience!?\nCans\nResilience IPA is packaged in cans by Sierra Nevada. The beer is starting to ship now. It will take some time for it to get from us, to the wholesalers, to the retailers. The amount of time depends on several factors, but distance is the main determiner. You can use our beer locator to find retailers nationwide that have it. The locator is updated continuously, so check back often.\nFind Resilience IPA at Retail\nDraught\nResilience IPA is available on draught from more than 1,400 breweries. You can use the brewer map below to locate participating breweries, and visit them for a pint!\nFind Resilience IPA on Draught\nBrewers\nThank you to the more than 1,400 breweries around the world who have so graciously volunteered to brew Resilience and donate 100% of the sales.

", " CLOSE Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. is releasing a special edition Resilience Butte County IPA that will send 100% of the proceeds to Camp Fire relief efforts. USA TODAY\nSierra Nevada Brewing Co. in Chico, California, in making Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, the proceeds of which will support Camp Fire relief efforts. (Photo: Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.)\nThe deadliest fire in California history has set into motion the largest charitable collaboration ever among the nation's breweries, as more than 1,200 have signed on to brew a beer to raise funds for those affected by the Camp Fire in Northern California.\nSierra Nevada Brewing Co., which is located in Chico, California, part of Butte County but west of the areas hardest hit by the fire, fed first responders and displaced residents during the fire and handed out clothing, too.\nBut Ken Grossman, who founded the brewery in 1980, wanted to do more. He decided to brew a special beer, Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, and donate all the proceeds to the Sierra Nevada Camp Fire Relief Fund, which it seeded with a $100,000 donation.\nThen, Grossman asked other breweries across the U.S. to join in. \"We are working with malt, hop and yeast suppliers to provide raw ingredient donations to all participating breweries and are asking those breweries to donate 100 percent of their sales to the fund, as well,\" he said in the letter, a copy of which is posted online.\n\"We know that the rebuilding process will take time, but we're in this for the long haul,\" Grossman said. \"Our hope is to get Resilience IPA in taprooms all over the country to create a solid start for our community's future.\"\nMore: Paradise fire survivor: 'This was my home before, and I want it to be again'\nMore: Colossal California wildfire finally contained; grim search for bodies continues\nCollaboration is common among independent brewers, and so is the brewing of charity beers. But the response to Sierra Nevada's Camp Fire initiative has been historic. \"I'm quite sure that it's both the largest-ever collaboration and the biggest industry charity ever,\" said Garrett Oliver, brewmaster at Brooklyn Brewery.\nSo far, more than 1,000 breweries have pledged to make their own batches of Resilience Butte County Proud IPA. \"This is a great idea spearheaded by a great indie craft brewing pioneer supporting a great cause,\" said Sam Calagione, co-founder of Dogfish Head Craft Brewery in Milton, Delaware, which brewed its batch of Resilience IPA and plans to serve it in late December.\n\"Our thoughts are with all of the brave folks who have helped navigate this challenging moment in Northern California and all of the families who have lost love ones,\" Calagione said. \"The craft brewing community has always been altruistic and mutually supportive, and giving back to our communities is one of the things we collectively do best.\"\nDogfish Head Craft Brewery in Milton, Delaware, is one of about 1,000 breweries joining Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. in making Resilience Butte County IPA, the proceeds of which will support Camp Fire relief efforts. (Photo: Dogfish Head Craft Brewery)\nAnother of the participating breweries, Fort Collins, Colorado-headquartered New Belgium Brewing, recalls the hardship caused by the nearby 2012 High Park fire. The brewery's paperboard manufacturer, Graphic Packaging International, is located in Oroville, California, in Butte County.\n\"Many of their co-workers have tragically lost their homes, yet they're still coming to work every day. That is the definition of resilience, and we're happy to support recovery efforts in any way that we can,\" New Belgium Brewing CEO Steve Fechheimer said. New Belgium brewed its batch Tuesday and plans to make it available at its Fort Collins and Asheville tasting rooms in about two weeks.\n\"At New Belgium, we believe that business can be a force for good, and we think that ethos is shared throughout the craft beer community,\" Fechheimer said.\nSierra Nevada Brewing Co. in Chico, California, in making Resilience Butte County Proud IPA, the proceeds of which will support Camp Fire relief efforts. (Photo: Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.)\nSierra Nevada brewed its batch of more than 74,000 gallons on Tuesday and plans to release it Jan. 5, 2019. Sierra will can some of that beer and also make it available on draft. Other participating breweries will only sell Resilience IPA on draft, with most releases planned in late December and early January. Overall, the project should yield about 8.6 million pints of beer, the brewery estimates.\nBreweries joining include small, midsize and regional breweries nationwide as well as Anheuser-Busch-owned Goose Island Beer Co. and Miller Coors-owned Blue Moon Brewing Co. For a list of the breweries participating, go to Sierra Nevada's website. There's also a Google Doc on the brewery site, now listing more than 1,200 breweries on board.\nThere are now more than 1,000 breweries listed on the @SierraNevada\nResilience Butte County Proud IPA page. Pretty awesome reminder of how the brewing community can come together.https://t.co/Z2hB12BSlq - Bart Watson (@BrewersStats) November 27, 2018\n\"Even as the beer industry has grown so much since the early days and become increasingly competitive, it is so wonderful to see hundreds of breweries nationwide rallying behind one of the movement's absolute most important pioneers,\" said Greg Engert, beer director for Neighborhood Restaurant Group in Alexandria, Virginia, which brewed a batch of the IPA at its Bluejacket brewery in Washington, D.C.\nSierra Nevada's Grossman had hopes of sharing the beer's recipe with perhaps 500 breweries that would also make the beer and donate the proceeds. \"That was kind of his pie-in-the-sky goal; if we really work hard maybe we can hit 500 breweries, and we have doubled that number,\" brewery spokesperson Robin Gregory said. \"I know he wanted to raise at least seven figures, and it looks like, if our math is correct, it's going to be a bit higher than that.\"\nStone is proud to be participating in @SierraNevada's #ResilienceIPA charity efforts. Sierra Nevada has come up with this new beer recipe and shared it with hundreds of other craft breweries to support those who now need our help after the fire. pic.twitter.com/31mZ1fjOw0 - Stone Brewing (@StoneBrewing) November 27, 2018\nThe Camp Fire took the lives of at least 85, with another 249 listed as missing, and destroyed nearly 19,000 buildings. About 15 percent of Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. employees lost their homes in the fire, as did \"countless friends and family members as well,\" she said.\nEven before the fire was officially extinguished, the brewery had set up the relief fund. \"Once the fire is out, we will distribute all donated money to partner organizations that are dedicated to rebuilding and supporting the communities that have been affected,\" Grossman said in a note on the brewery's website, also signed by daughter Sierra and son Brian.\nThe beer is a \"really classic\" West Coast-style India pale ale made with Centennial and Cascade hops, Gregory said. \"If it's going to be raising money to rebuild our community, we felt like it should be a taste of home. We wanted to go with that classic danky west coast IPA ... (that is) fresh, piney, citrusy, hop-heavy, and nice and bright.\"\nThank you @ButteSheriff@KoryHonea for helping us brew Resilience Butte County Proud IPA today.

Sierra Nevada, along with many of its professional brewing peers, will be brewing and selling Resilience IPA with all proceeds donated to the Sierra Nevada Camp Fire Relief Fund through Golden Valley Community Bank Foundation.\nIt is our hope that homebrewers will make a batch of Resilience IPA in solidarity with Sierra Nevada and pro breweries across the country.

Overall, the company expects the effort to produce about 8.6 million pints. Resilience is described as a \"classic\" West Coast-style IPA (here's the recipe for homebrewers).

Kavanaugh is appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday as senators continue publicly interviewing President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court.\nKavanaugh, a member of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has a good chance of being confirmed when the Senate votes later this month. Under questioning from senators, he has so far touched on Roe v. Wade, said courts - not the president - are \"the final word\" and, as the hearing began, watched drama unfold regarding Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.)'s pledge to release confidential documents.\nKey moments from the hearing:\n  Drama over confidential emails....that were already cleared for public release\n  Kavanaugh advised against calling Roe \"settled law\"\n  Kavanaugh elaborates on dissent on contraception and religious objections\n  Emails show more involvement with nominee than Kavanaugh previously suggested\n10:13 p.m.: Hearing adjourned\nMore than 12 hours after the questioning began Thursday morning, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) adjourned the confirmation hearing for the day. Grassley closed the session by praising Kavanaugh for his \"compelling and credible\" answers, highlighted his history on the bench and said that \"unquestionably, you're qualified to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States.\"\n\"I hope a lot of people in this country have formed very positive views of you, as I have,\" Grassley said.\nKavanaugh spent nearly 24 hours over two days answering questions, with many of the discussions on Thursday centering in some way or another on President Trump, who nominated Kavanaugh to the high court. Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including some Republicans, pressed Kavanaugh about his expansive views of presidential power and past writings that concluded civil suits and criminal investigations of presidents would be better delayed until the chief executive left office. Read more about Thursday's hearing here.\nFriday is the fourth and final scheduled day of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing, which will feature comments from witnesses.\n- Mark Berman\n8:55 p.m.: Behind the dramatic release of once-concealed documents\nThe dramatic release Thursday of once-concealed documents from Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh's tenure in the George W. Bush White House spotlighted the simmering frustrations from Democrats over how Republicans have kept secret vast parts of Kavanaugh's voluminous paper trail.\nTens of thousands of pages from Kavanaugh's records have been hidden from public view, only available to senators and certain congressional aides in advance of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings this week.\nOn Thursday, a small sample of the \"committee confidential\" documents were disclosed after Democratic senators asked that they be approved for public release, raising questions about why the documents had been considered confidential in the first place.\nRead more here.\n7:30 p.m.: Pressed on gay rights, Kavanaugh declines to say same-sex marriage ruling was correctly decided\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) pressed Kavanaugh for the first time Thursday night about gay rights. The judge refused to answer whether the high court's ruling declaring a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry was correctly decided.\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy, the man Kavanaugh would replace on the bench, cast the deciding vote in the case, Obergefell v. Hodges.\nKavanaugh instead read aloud from another Kennedy ruling this year involving gay rights in which the justice wrote that gay people \"cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth.\"\nHarris noted that Kavanaugh earlier this week characterized the landmark decision declaring segregated schools unconstitutional as a great moment in history, and asked whether the high court's decision legalizing gay marriage was a similar moment.\nThe judge said only that it was precedent.\nThe White House sent out information on Kavanaugh's record on gay rights soon after the exchange, noting that Kavanaugh has not had a major case involving gay rights in his 12 years on the D.C. Circuit.\n\"Kavanaugh rules fairly and impartially based on the law, not the identity of the parties before him, and he has a record of faithfully applying legal protections for racial minorities, women, and other protected groups,\"the White House statement said.\n- Ann E. Marimow\n7:11 p.m.: Kavanaugh, pressed again, said he has not discussed the Mueller probe\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who late Wednesday asked Kavanaugh if he had discussed special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election with attorneys at the law firm founded by President Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, questioned him again Thursday.\nPicking up a line of inquiry that her colleagues, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), had followed during the day, Harris peppered him with follow-up questions. Noting that he had denied having \"inappropriate\" conversations about it, Harris asking Kavanaugh if he had discussions regarding the special counsel's probe and whether he had discussed it with anyone at Kasowitz's firm, saying she had unspecified \"reliable information\" he had done the latter. (The firm denied this earlier in the day).\nKavanaugh asked Harris if she was asking whether he spoke to anyone specific about it, but she said that was not the question.\n\"That is not the subject of the question, sir,\" she said. \"The subject of the question is you and whether you were part of a conversation regarding special counsel Mueller's investigation.\"\nKavanaugh, nearly a day after their exchange late Wednesday, responded: \"The answer's no.\"\nHarris replied by thanking him and saying \"it would have been great if you could've said that last night,\" prompting Kavanaugh to begin a reply before cutting him off.\n\"Let's move on,\" Harris said.\nThe end of the exchange prompted a rare reaction from White House counsel Donald McGahn, who has largely kept his poker face during the hearings while seated behind Kavanaugh in clear view of the cameras. After Harris's remark about moving on, McGahn gave a slight shake of his head and briefly arched his eyebrows.\n- Mark Berman\n6:52 p.m.: Booker asks why Kavanaugh won't recuse himself from the Mueller probe\nHours after Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) took center stage with drama over some of the documents the committee had, he had a chance to speak to Kavanaugh, pressing the judge on a variation of a question he had been asked previously during the hearings: Why not recuse himself from any court matters that would involve the ongoing special counsel probe because, as Booker said, \"it's really important that the Supreme Court be above suspicion\"?\nKavanaugh responded by saying doing so would mean showing he did not have judicial independence.\n\"All I would be doing is demonstrating that I don't have the independence of the judiciary ... that is necessary to be a good judge,\" Kavanaugh responded. \"All of the nominees who've gone before have declined to commit because that would be inconsistent with judicial independence.\"\n- Seung Min Kim\n5:50 p.m.: Hearing pauses for dinner\nThe hearing was halted until 6:15 p.m. for a dinner break. After that, four senators will get their turns to question Kavanaugh before the committee opens up a new round of questioning.\n5:15 p.m.: Kavanaugh declines to condemn Trump's attacks on judiciary\nKavanaugh refused to repudiate what Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) described as President Trump's \"blatant, craven and repeated attacks\" on the federal judiciary.\nBlumenthal was referring to Trump's criticism that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \"has embarrassed us all\" and \"her mind is shot.\" Ginsburg had been critical of Trump, prompting him to make the comments on Twitter during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nKavanaugh took a pass, saying he did not want to \"get within three Zip codes\" of such a political controversy.\nBlumemthal noted that the president's first Supreme Court pick, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, explicitly condemned Trump's attacks as \"disheartening\" and \"demoralizing.\" Gorsuch spoke generally, but his comments came after the president had criticized the ethnic background of Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who ruled against the administration's travel ban.\nSen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) followed up, suggesting that the judge was resisting any criticism of President Trump.\nKavanaugh disagreed. As a judge, he said, \"We stay out of politics, we don't comment on comments made by politicians.\"\n- Ann E. Marimow\n5:08 p.m.: Blumenthal presses Kavanaugh on Mueller probe\nThe ongoing special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election took center stage at the hearing again Thursday afternoon - this time, in a line of questioning from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).\nFollowing questions on Wednesday night and again Thursday morning, Kavanaugh was again pressed about special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe, which could eventually make its way before a Supreme Court featuring Kavanaugh as a member.\nBlumenthal asked Kavanaugh if he had ever discussed the investigation with anyone, and Kavanaugh echoed his earlier remark in saying: \"I've had no inappropriate discussions with anyone.\"\nBlumenthal followed that by asking if the judge had ever discussed the investigation with anyone, whether appropriately or inappropriately. Kavanaugh acknowledged that it had come up - \"If you're walking around in America it's coming up, senator\" - but he also repeatedly emphasized that he never crossed any lines in discussing it.\n\"I've never suggested anything about my views about anything, commitments, foreshadowing, I've had no inappropriate discussions,\" he said.\nBlumenthal then pivoted to asking if Kavanaugh had discussed it with anyone in the White House, including Donald McGahn, the White House counsel seated behind Kavanaugh during the hearings. When Blumenthal asked Kavanaugh if he had discussed the probe with McGahn or anyone else in the White House, calling it a yes or no question, Kavanaugh said: \"I'm not remembering any discussions like that.\"\nHe added, though, that during his preparations for the confirmation hearings, he had readied for queries like the ones Blumenthal had posed. The questioning grew mildly tense, with Blumenthal suggesting that Kavanaugh's answers were ambiguous, which the judge disputed.\nAfter Blumenthal finished his questioning, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) broke in to ask Kavanaugh if he had ever suggested to anyone how he would rule on any matter related to the Mueller probe, and the judge answered: \"No, I have not.\"\nBlumenthal followed up his questions about the probe by asking whether Kavanaugh had discussed the inquiry with anyone at the law firm founded by President Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz.\nEarlier on Thursday, the firm Kasowitz Benson Torres said in a statement that \"no discussions\" regarding the probe had occurred \"between Judge Kavanaugh and anyone at our firm.\"\nWhen asked by Blumenthal, Kavanaugh echoed his earlier comments that he did not remember any discussions with anyone at the firm about the probe. When asked if he knew Kasowitz, Kavanaugh said no.\nWhen asked if he knew anyone at the firm, Kavanaugh said yes, naming Ed McNally, who used to work at the White House counsel's office and is now at the firm. Kavanaugh said he had not discussed the special counsel's probe with McNally.\n- Mark Berman\n3:35 p.m.: Kavanaugh tries to clarify involvement in judge's confirmation\nKavanaugh on Thursday discussed his involvement in the confirmation of now-Judge William H. Pryor Jr. to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit - clarifying his testimony from 2004 when he said he hadn't handled that nomination when he served as an associate White House counsel.\nThe nominee's comments came after the new disclosure of emails earlier Thursday that detailed what appeared to be Kavanaugh's involvement in Pryor's confirmation fight, including conference calls to coordinate strategy and meetings to discuss plans for the nominee's hearings.\nKavanaugh explained Thursday that in the George W. Bush White House counsel's office, one person would be assigned to handle the confirmation of each judicial nominee. \"As I recall at least, I was not the primary person on that,\" Kavanaugh said, referring to Pryor's nomination.\nWhile Kavanaugh said he didn't recall specifics of his involvement, some examples he cited were attendance at meetings and mock hearing sessions.\nIn 2004, during his confirmation hearing for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kavanaugh said several times under questioning by then-Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) that he had not been involved with Pryor's confirmation.\n\"I am familiar generally with Mr. Pryor, but that was not one that I worked on personally,\" Kavanaugh testified then, although he noted during the hearing that he knew Pryor. Upon further questioning, Kavanaugh said: \"I was not involved in handling his nomination.\"\nKavanaugh, with the help of Grassley, clarified another one of the emails involving Pryor. On Dec. 16, 2002, Kavanaugh received an email from another White House aide with the subject line \"CA11\" - a reference to the 11th Circuit. The aide, Kyle Sampson, asked: \"How did the Pryor interview go?\" Kavanaugh then responded: \"Call me.\"\nGrassley, noting that Democrats attempted to \"insinuate that you interviewed Judge Pryor,\" asked Kavanaugh: It's \"more likely to indicate that you know the people who interviewed Judge Pryor?\"\nKavanaugh responded: \"That sounds correct.\"\n- Seung Min Kim\n2:56 p.m.: Kavanaugh elaborates on dissent on contraception and religious objections\nAdvocates for reproductive rights are concerned about the contraceptive-coverage requirement in the Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare. In a 2015 case, Kavanaugh dissented from his colleagues and sided with the group Priests for Life, which argued that a provision in the law to opt out for religious objections was too burdensome.\nKavanaugh elaborated Thursday on the basis for his dissent, telling Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) that \"the government had ways to ensure contraceptive coverage without doing so on the backs of religious objectors.\"\nThe issue remains in court after the Trump administration issued new rules making it easier for employers to refuse to provide coverage for birth control on the basis of religious objections.\nCruz also asked the judge about a case on which he worked as a lawyer in private practice in which he backed a high school's decision to allow student-led prayers over the public address system at football games. He argued that students were delivering their own messages, not speaking on behalf of the school. The Supreme Court disagreed, finding the policy unconstitutional.\n\"Religious people, speakers and speech are entitled to equal treatment,\" Kavanaugh said Thursday.\n- Ann E. Marimow\n2:41 p.m.: Kasowitz firm denies discussing special counsel probe with Kavanaugh\nIn one of the most widely noticed parts of the hearings, Kavanaugh was questioned late Wednesday by Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) about whether he had discussed special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election with attorneys at the law firm founded by President Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz.\nOn Thursday, Kavanaugh was asked again about this by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who gave the judge an opportunity to clarify his responses to Harris. Kavanaugh said he did not \"recall any conversations of that kind,\" adding that he was not familiar with the names of all of the attorneys from the firm Kasowitz Benson Torres.\nKavanaugh said he had not had any \"inappropriate conversations\" or commented on his views about the legal aspects of the probe, elements of which could potentially make it to the Supreme Court.\nOn Thursday, the Kasowitz firm also said that no one there had discussed the probe with Kavanaugh.\n\"There have been no discussions regarding Robert Mueller's investigation between Judge Kavanaugh and anyone at our firm,\" the law firm said in a statement.\n- Mark Berman\n1:57 p.m.: Hearings resume after lunch break\nAfter pausing for lunch, the hearings are getting back underway. The first hours brought an extended drama over documents as well as questions about abortion, executive power and the special counsel's probe, with extensive questioning still expected for the remainder of the day.\n1:38 p.m.: The drama over 'confidential' emails - which were already cleared for public release\nDemocrats mounted dramatic protests Thursday over documents related to Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh's tenure in the George W. Bush White House, as senators began releasing his emails that had been withheld from the public.\nThe records that Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) posted on their websites Thursday morning had, in fact, already been cleared for public release, according to Democratic and Republican aides on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Those documents were cleared earlier Thursday morning, according to spokesmen for both sides.\nNevertheless, the drama over the emails once marked \"committee confidential\" engulfed much of the third day of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, with Booker vowing to disclose them in defiance of Senate rules.\n\"I openly invite and accept the consequences of releasing that email right now,\" Booker said. \"The emails are being withheld from the public have nothing to do with national security.\"\nBill Burck, Bush's presidential records representative, said later Thursday, \"We cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Booker's staff asked us to. We were surprised to learn about Senator Booker's histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly. In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public.\"\nSuch theatrics have characterized Kavanaugh's hearings, in which Democrats have repeatedly complained that Republicans have withheld documents from the committee and the public that shed important light on Kavanaugh's past.\nThe documents that took center stage on Thursday were labeled \"committee confidential\" - available for any senators to view but shielded from the public.\nLate Wednesday, a handful of Democratic senators sent Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) several requests to make emails once marked \"committee confidential\" available to the public so they could discuss them during the public hearing on Thursday. Those records are being cleared as the Justice Department reviews them, as well as representatives for Bush.\nBooker may have violated Senate rules late Wednesday, when he spoke about the content of emails that technically were still under \"committee confidential\" status at that point.\n\"You've also written that an effort designed to benefit minority-owned businesses, an effort to try to give them a fair shake because they had been historically excluded - and these are your words now - used a lot of legalisms and disguises to mask what is, in reality, a naked racial set-aside. That's what you said. That's how you referred to it,\" Booker said, referring to one of the emails from Kavanaugh.\nLater in his questioning, Booker referred again to the committee confidential emails: \"I have letters here, sir, that have asked for - now, the one email specifically entitled racial profiling that somehow - I mean, literally the email was entitled racial profiling, that somehow was designated as something that the public couldn't see. This wasn't - this wasn't personal information.\"\nReleasing \"committee confidential\" information violates Senate rules and could result in expulsion from the Senate. But whether the Senate actually pursues the violation is a separate question.\n- Seung Min Kim\n1:17 p.m.: Hearing pauses for lunch\nGrassley paused the hearing for a lunch break, which he said would take 30 minutes but potentially longer, noting that senators have two votes scheduled this afternoon.\n1:10 p.m.: Court orders, not the president, are \"the final word,\" Kavanaugh says\nSenate Democrats raised concerns Thursday about the president's attacks this week on the Justice Department and Kavanaugh's broad view of executive power expressed in his legal opinions and speeches. In a tweet on Monday, Trump criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for the recent indictments of two Republican congressmen, the latest in a string of criticisms the president has levied against both Sessions and the department he leads.\n\"In this age of President Donald Trump, this expansive view of presidential power takes on added significance,\" said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).\nKavanaugh emphasized the importance of the separation of powers and an independent judiciary as a backstop.\n\"I've made clear in my writings that a court order that requires a president to do something or prohibits president from doing something is the final word in our system,\" Kavanaugh said.\n- Ann E. Marimow\n12:32 p.m.: Hearing resumes\nAfter a 15-minute break that lasted for about 25 minutes, Kavanaugh has taken his seat again to answer questions.\n12 p.m.: Read Kavanaugh's email on Roe v. Wade\nIn an email Kavanaugh wrote in 2003 that was made public Thursday, he argued against calling the decision \"settled law of the land.\"\nIn his email, Kavanaugh wrote that he was \"not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe\" that way, noting that the Supreme Court \"can always overrule its precedent.\"\nWhen asked about the email by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on Thursday, Kavanaugh said he was not expressing his own views, but rather those of \"legal scholars.\"\nRead his email here. And head here for more on what else he has said on the issue.\n- Mark Berman\n11:27 a.m.: Kavanaugh denies any \"inappropriate conversations\" about special counsel probe\nLate Wednesday night, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) questioned Kavanaugh about whether he had discussed the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election with attorneys at the law firm founded by President Trump's personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz.\nThe exchange drew intense scrutiny online, and on Thursday, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) gave Kavanaugh an opportunity to clarify his responses to Harris, who did not disclose with whom she suspected the judge may have had such conversations.\n\"I don't recall any conversations of that kind,\" Kavanaugh told Hatch, adding that he was not familiar with the names of all of the attorneys from the firm Kasowitz Benson Torres.\nKavanaugh stressed that he had not had any \"inappropriate conversations\" or commented on his views about the legal aspects of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation that could make their way to the Supreme Court.\n\"No hints, forecasts, previews, winks - nothing about my view as a judge or how I would rule on that or anything related to that,\" Kavanaugh said.\n- Ann E. Marimow\n11:20 a.m.: Emails show more involvement with controversial judicial nominee than Kavanaugh previously suggested\nKavanaugh testified in 2004 that he did not \"personally\" handle the nomination of a controversial George W. Bush judicial candidate: Judge William Pryor, who now sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. But emails made newly public early Thursday show more involvement than he appeared to indicate in his 2004 testimony.\nOn Dec. 16, 2002, Kavanaugh received an email, reviewed by The Washington Post, from another White House aide with the subject line \"CA11\" - a reference to the 11th Circuit. The aide, Kyle Sampson, asked: \"How did the Pryor interview go?\" Kavanaugh then responded: \"Call me.\"\nAnother email from June 5, 2003 reviewed by The Post showed Kavanaugh on an email chain with a handful of other officials, alerting them to a 4 p.m. conference call to \"discuss Pryor and coordinate plans and efforts.\" A separate email earlier that day, on which Kavanaugh was blind carbon copied, discussed a meeting that would be held the following day to \"discuss nominee Bill Pryor's hearing\" the following week.\nKavanaugh was nominated by Bush on April 9, 2003, and his confirmation hearing was held June 11, 2003. He was confirmed in 2005.\nIn 2004 during his confirmation hearing for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kavanaugh said several times under questioning by then-Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) that he had not been involved with Pryor's confirmation.\n\"I am familiar generally with Mr. Pryor, but that was not one that I worked on personally,\" Kavanaugh testified then. Upon further questioning, Kavanaugh said \"I was not involved in handling his nomination.\"\nPryor drew controversy because he had called Roe v. Wade \"the worst abomination of constitutional law in our history.\" As attorney general of Alabama, he had filed an amicus brief in a key Supreme Court case on gay rights, Lawrence v. Texas, that struck down state sodomy laws. Pryor wrote that states should \"remain free to protect the moral standards of their communities through legislation that prohibits homosexual sodomy.\"\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), one of the swing votes on Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court, voted against Pryor's confirmation in 2005.\nWhite House spokesman Raj Shah did not immediately return a request for comment on the newly disclosed Pryor emails.\nA spokesman for the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), said some previously \"committee confidential\" documents are being made public as they are cleared by the Justice Department. Other records that have been requested to be made public are still being reviewed by DOJ and representatives for Bush.\n- Seung Min Kim\n11:01 a.m.: Kavanaugh advised against calling Roe \"settled law,\" email shows\nWhile he was a White House lawyer in the Bush administration, Kavanaugh advised against referring to the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade as the \"settled law of the land,\" according to a 2003 email made public Thursday.\n\"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so,\" Kavanaugh wrote after reviewing a draft of what was intended to be an op-ed in favor of a judicial nominee.\nKavanaugh addressed the decision on Wednesday, refusing to say whether he believed that Roe v. Wade, the decision that guaranteed a woman's right to an abortion, was correctly decided. He also said the Supreme Court had affirmed it in subsequent cases.\nOn Thursday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) read aloud from Kavanaugh's newly released email and said it has \"been viewed as you saying you don't think Roe is settled\" and asked him to explain.\nKavanaugh said he was referring not to his own views, but to the \"views of legal scholars.\"\nRead more here.\n- Mark Berman\n10:45 a.m.: On cameras in the court, Kavanaugh said he is open to hearing from other justices\nKavanaugh was asked about a common question regarding the court: Cameras or no cameras?\nThe Supreme Court itself operates in a relatively anachronistic format, blocking cameras - and most other forms of technology - when cases are argued and announced. The question of whether it should remain that way has been raised over the years, including to nominees who went on to join the court. During Justice Neil M. Gorsuch's confirmation hearings last year, he said he was open to hearing more about the issue.\nKavanaugh also said he was open to learning more, including from the justices already on the court to hear \"what they think about this.\"\n\"To learn, if I were to be confirmed, from the experience there and to see what the experience there is like,\" he said. \"To listen to the justices currently on the Supreme Court.\"\n- Mark Berman\n10:38 a.m.: Questioning begins and is promptly interrupted by protesters\nAn hour after the hearing got underway, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the committee chairman, began his questioning of Kavanaugh, who had not spoken while senators debated what to do with confidential documents.\nA protester shouting about health care and chanting \"SHAME\" was taken outside by police as Grassley began. Then, as Kavanaugh began to speak, a male protester quickly interrupted, standing on a chair and shouting, \"Save Democracy, save Roe!\" as he was hauled out of the committee room by the Capitol Police.\n10:30 a.m.: Senate Democrats in open revolt over confidential Kavanaugh documents\nAfter Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said he was willing to violate Senate rules and release confidential documents, Senate Democrats on the committee appeared in open revolt as Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) read aloud from the rules on expulsion. Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, also tweeted the rules on Thursday morning.\nCornyn read aloud from rules stating that a senator who discloses \"the secret or confidential business\" of the Senate could be \"liable ... to suffer expulsion.\"\nBooker responded by saying: \"Bring the charges.\" His comment was echoed by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who said: \"Apply the rule, bring the charges. All of us are ready to face that rule.\"\n\"This is about the closest I'll ever have in my life to an 'I am Spartacus' moment,\" Booker said.\nSen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) also joined in, saying: \"If there's going to be some retribution against the senator from New Jersey, count me in.\"\nTheir comments were echoed by Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who tweeted during the debate: \"I stand w/ Judiciary Committee Democrats who are well within their rights to release these very important documents that a former Kavanaugh deputy designed as 'committee confidential.' The American ppl deserve to know the truth about Judge Kavanaugh's record. #WhatAreTheyHiding?\"\n- Ann E. Marimow\n10 a.m.: Booker says he is willing to violate Senate rules to release confidential documents\nThe fight over access to Kavanaugh's records from his time in the Bush White House intensified in the opening moments of the hearing Thursday morning. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said he is prepared to violate Senate rules and release confidential committee documents - and to risk the consequences.\nBooker had questioned Kavanaugh Wednesday night about his use of the term \"naked racial set-aside\" and said he would make public documents backing up that assertion.\n\"I openly invite and accept the consequences of releasing that email right now,\" Booker said. \"The emails being withheld from the public have nothing to do with national security.\"\nUnder the committee's rules, Booker could be expelled from the Senate for releasing such records.\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) angrily responded to Booker and referred to his potential aspirations for higher office, saying \"running for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate.\" Cornyn argued that \"this is no different from the senator deciding to release classified information that is deemed classified.\"\n9:34 a.m.: Hearing gets underway\nNearly 12 hours after the first day of questioning wrapped up, Kavanaugh is back before the Senate Judiciary Committee for more questioning. Kavanaugh took his seat at 9:33 a.m., sitting alone at the witness table with a stack of papers to his left and three small water bottles to his right.\nBefore the hearing began, the committee's Republican members were seen gathered around committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) while he spoke before they took their seats.\nGrassley gaveled in the hearing at 9:34 a.m.\n- Mark Berman\n8 a.m.: What to watch for in today's hearing\nThe third day of hearings will see Kavanaugh facing more questioning from senators. Among other things to expect and watch for:\n  The battle over access to records from Kavanaugh's tenure in the Bush White House is sure to resurface, with Democrats asking the committee to release additional documents that have not been disclosed to the public.\nSen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) implied Wednesday that there is evidence in confidential Senate Judiciary Committee records that Kavanaugh in 2003 was privy to an email allegedly stolen by a former committee staffer. Kavanaugh said he never knowingly dealt with stolen records. Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) did not guarantee that those documents would become public this week, but said, \"we'll try to get them.\"\n  More questions are likely about Kavanaugh's views on a host of pivotal issues, including guns, abortion, executive power, health care, affirmative action and more, as well as about his experiences on the bench and in the Bush White House.\n  Health care and the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act will continue to be a potent issue, particularly as a legal challenge to the law unfolds in a courtroom in Texas this week. The nominee says he can't assure senators that he would uphold the law's requirement that insurers cover people with preexisting conditions because doing so would compromise his judicial independence. Democrats say they will revisit the issue.\n  Loud, angry protests are likely to continue to punctuate the Senate debate about Kavanaugh's legal theory and judicial opinions. A phalanx of Capitol Police officers, dressed in dark blue and some with zip ties, have been a fixture against the back wall of the hearing room, poised to quietly haul out protesters. Capitol Police on Wednesday arrested and charged another 66 people with disorderly conduct for disrupting the hearings.\n  In one of the most confusing - and tense - exchanges Wednesday, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) raised the prospect without offering evidence that Kavanaugh may have spoken about the Mueller investigation with somebody at Kasowitz, Benson and Torres, a law firm that has represented Trump. It's unclear whether Harris will revisit the issue again Thursday, but the exchange went viral and quickly became one of the most talked-about moments of the Kavanaugh hearings.\n\nSupreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh appears during a confirmation hearing at the Hart Senate Office Building on Wednesday in Washington. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\nRead more coverage:\nRead Day One and Day Two of the Kavanaugh hearing\nThe Fix: 5 takeaways from the Brett Kavanaugh hearings so far\nThe Daily 202: Kavanaugh hearing offers an 'unprecedented' display of the Senate's institutional decline\nRead more at PowerPost ", " Washington (CNN) Brett Kavanaugh emerged from two days of tough questioning in the Senate Judiciary Committee without making any obvious missteps that could imperil his confirmation as the justice who will pull the Supreme Court to the right and hand Donald Trump a generational presidential legacy.\nHe avoided ceding ground on the most contentious issues, either by saying he wanted to keep \"three zip codes\" away from politics or by arguing that he could not comment on \"hypothetical\" cases that could come before him on the nation's top bench.\nKavanaugh refused to say whether a sitting president must respond to a subpoena -- not an academic issue in the age of Trump. He declined to agree to Democratic calls for him to recuse himself from any cases related to the Russia investigation. And he would not say where he would come down on abortion, amid expectations among conservatives he would like to overturn Roe v. Wade.\nBut Democrats did not walk away from a deeply divisive hearing with nothing. Top lawmakers showed vigor in cross examining Kavanaugh and by portraying him as Trump's man on the court and may have at least partly lived up to expectations of the party's fired up base for a show of backbone ahead of the mid-term elections.\nAfter emerging largely unscathed after the final round of questions from senators that stretched late into Thursday evening, Kavanaugh could take comfort in passing his biggest test. If Republicans stick together he is almost certain to be confirmed while minority Democrats face their own challenge in keeping the votes of red state senators with tough re-election races in their column.\nBooker's document fight\nThursday's hearing featured another bitter showdown between Democrats who are furious at the failure of the White House to hand over tens of thousands of key documents on time or at all, and at restrictions on the public release of material that was made available.\nNew Jersey Democrat Cory Booker said he was ready to risk expulsion from the Senate for making public documents pertinent Kavanaugh's time as a top White House aide to President George W. Bush, but the GOP mocked him for grandstanding ahead of a possible 2020 run -- saying it had already cleared the emails for release.\nIn a striking political gambit, Booker, backed up by Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, released emails -- which had been designated as \"committee confidential\" -- that reference Kavanaugh's position on racial profiling and thoughts on Roe v. Wade dating from his time as a White House official under Bush.\nBooker, who as a potential 2020 presidential candidate had an incentive to make a splash in the hearing, said he took the action as an act of \"civil disobedience.\"\n\"I understand the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate. ... I openly invite and accept the consequences of my team releasing that email right now,\" Booker said.\n\"This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an 'I am Spartacus' moment,\" he added.\nRepublican Sen John Cornyn warned Booker that releasing documents marked \"committee confidential\" would break Senate rules.\n\"Running for president is not an excuse for violating the rules of the Senate,\" the Texas Republican said.\nLater Thursday, Bill Burck, a lawyer who oversaw the process of providing Bush administration documents, undercut Booker's grand gesture, saying that the material in question had been cleared on Wednesday night at the request of the senator's staff.\n\"We were surprised to learn about Senator Booker's histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly. In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public,\" Burck said in a statement.\nThe office of Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, also said that senators, including Booker, were notified \"before they spoke today\" that the restrictions on the documents had been waived.\nBooker, however, insisted he was in the right, saying he read from the documents aloud in the hearing on Wednesday night long before they were cleared at around 4 a.m. Democrats have repeatedly complained that the White House is withholding tens of thousands of documents relevant to the nomination and wants many more that have been provided released to the public.\nThe New Jersey senator also said he doubted Cornyn would follow through on his threats to enforce Senate discipline against him.\n\"I think he's like a lot of bullies are: a lot of talk, no action,\" Booker said.\nNorth Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis took exception to his Democratic colleague's tactics.\n\"Certainly in the six hours between the time that email hit your email box and the theatrics that happened in this chamber today you could have actually found out that you didn't have to be Spartacus, you didn't have to go interact with civil disobedience, you got what you wanted,\" Tillis said.\nThe schoolyard taunts underlined how the hearing, ahead of what appears to be Kavanaugh's likely confirmation, has become another battlefield in the vicious partisanship and complete lack of trust between the parties that is wracking Washington at a critical moment of the Trump era\nBooker's intervention followed a set of glowing reviews from liberals for another potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidate on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who late Wednesday night appeared to discomfort Kavanaugh with a series of questions designed to find out with whom he had discussed special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.\nHarris returned to the question on Thursday evening, saying that she had been working on \"reliable information\" that Kavanaugh had a conversation about the probe with someone from Kasowitz Benson Torres, the law firm founded by Trump's personal attorney Marc Kasowitz.\nKavanaugh had sidestepped the question on Wednesday, so Harris asked him again and he replied \"the answer's no.\"\nEarlier, the firm said in a statement to CNN there had been no such discussions.\nHarris did not disclose the \"reliable information\" on which she based her questions.\nJUST WATCHED Senator challenges Kavanaugh on Mueller probe Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Senator challenges Kavanaugh on Mueller probe 02:55\n2003 email shows Kavanaugh discussing Roe\nIn another flashpoint development, a previously unreleased 2003 email from Kavanaugh, while he was an official in the Bush White House, shows him raising the point of whether Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that upheld the right to an abortion, was settled law of the land.\nIn the internal White House email, obtained by CNN, Kavanaugh wrote: \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe v. Wade as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.\"\n\"The point there is in the inferior court point,\" Kavanaugh wrote, responding to a draft op-ed that had been circulated for edits between lawmakers and White House staff.\nThe draft, meant to be submitted under the name of \"high-profile, pro-choice\" women in support of a Bush judicial nominee, had said that \"it is widely understood accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land.\"\nDuring the confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Kavanaugh said: \"As a general proposition I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v. Wade.\"\nTrump said during his campaign that he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe. In recent years, Supreme Court nominees have gotten through their confirmation hearings by refusing to say how they would rule on what they say is a hypothetical future case on the issue.\nThe New York Times first reported the email.\nThroughout the contentious hearing, now in its third day, Kavanaugh has tried to give political questions -- especially those related to Trump and his potential legal woes -- a wide berth.\nOn Wednesday he insisted that \"no one is above the law\" but declined to say whether a sitting president must respond to a subpoena.\nSenate Democrats have suggested that Kavanaugh could be biased in favor of the President and worry that his views on the primacy of executive power could help Trump evade legal scrutiny.\nBooker warned that given Trump's frequent attacks on the Justice Department there was a \"shadow over the independence of the judiciary\" and said it was understandable for some Americans to wonder whether a nominee picked by the President would owe loyalty to him or had been nominated to shield him from a criminal investigation.\n\"My only loyalty is to the Constitution,\" Kavanaugh responded. \"I have made that clear, I am an independent judge.\" ", " Tweet with a location\nYou can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Dick Durbin, D-Ill., sought a promise from Kavanaugh that he would be willing to serve as a check on the president who nominated him.\n\"Give us some reassurance about your commitment to the democratic institutions in this country, in the face of a president who seems prepared to cast them aside,\" Durbin said. \"Whether it's voter suppression, the role of the media - case after case, we hear this president willing to walk away from the rule of law in this country.\"\n\"No one is above the law,\" Kavanaugh replied. \"I've made clear in my writings that a court order that requires a president to do something or prohibits a president from doing something under the Constitution or laws of the United States is the final word in our system.\"\nSen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, complained that the Supreme Court had been unduly deferential to President Trump this summer when it upheld his travel ban, despite what she called the administration's \"obviously bogus\" justification. She pressed Kavanaugh on when the high court should question a president's national security claims.\n\"National security is not a blank check for the president,\" Kavanaugh said, pointing to a number of cases in which the court had overruled the administration. \"Even in the context of wartime, the courts are not silenced. Civil liberties are not silent.\"\nKavanaugh told lawmakers he is so committed to judicial independence, he stopped voting in national elections after he became a judge.\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., again asked Kavanaugh if he'd ever spoken with anyone at the law firm of Trump's personal attorney Marc Kasowitz about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, renewing a line of questioning she'd opened Wednesday night.\n\"The answer is no,\" Kavanaugh said.\nAs he's done throughout the hearing, Kavanaugh declined to answer a series of questions from Harris about issues that might come before the high court, including abortion, same-sex marriage and immigration.\nThe White House issued a statement late Thursday praising Kavanaugh.\n\"Through long hours and days of questioning, Judge Kavanaugh consistently reinforced his firm belief in the bedrock principles of judicial independence and the rule of law,\" deputy press secretary Raj Shah said in the statement.\nKavanaugh was asked repeatedly during the televised hearing about whether he would support opening the Supreme Court to TV cameras. He promised to keep an open mind, but said he would also want to consider the views of the eight current justices.\nThursday's session began with Democrats on the committee in open revolt over the handling of documents from Kavanaugh's tenure in the George W. Bush White House.\nSome documents have been withheld altogether. Others have been provided to the committee on \"confidential\" terms, meaning senators can see them but they can't be made public.\nDemocrats object that the confidential label has been applied to a wide swath of records, many of which contain no personal or sensitive information. They also complain that classification decisions were made by former President Bush's attorney, William Burck, a former deputy of Kavanaugh's.\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., released some of the confidential documents Thursday morning. Hirono also released \"confidential\" documents, drawing a stern rebuke from Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who called them \"irresponsible and outrageous.\"\n\"This is no different from the senator deciding to release classified information,\" Cornyn said Thursday morning. \"No senator deserves to sit on this committee, or serve in the Senate, in my view, if they decide to be a law unto themselves and willingly flout the rules of the Senate and the determination of confidentiality and classification.\"\nRead the documents released by Sen. Hirono here and the documents released by Sen. Leahy here.\nFor all the theatrics on both sides, the debate over documents fizzled by Thursday afternoon, once it became clear their release had been authorized by Bush's attorney overnight.\n\"We cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Booker's staff asked us to,\" Burck said in a statement. \"In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public.\"\nAnd an aide to Grassley told NPR that \"counsels for the senators who requested waivers last night/this morning for particular documents were notified that their requests had been honored beginning at around 3:50 this morning.\"\nBut a spokesperson for Hirono said the senator was not informed that the documents released by her office Thursday morning had been approved to be made public.\nIt is not clear whether Booker knew the documents he released had already been approved before his statements Thursday morning at the beginning of the hearing - when he said that his decision to release the documents was a form of civil disobedience and that he was aware he was risking expulsion from the Senate for making the documents public.\n\"Cory said this morning that he was releasing committee confidential documents, and that's exactly what he's done,\" Booker spokeswoman Kristin Lynch said in an email to NPR. \"Last night, he was admonished by Republicans for breaking the rules when he read from committee confidential documents. Cory and Senate Democrats were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last night's documents publicly available, and Cory publicly released those documents as well as other committee confidential documents today. And he'll keep releasing them because Republicans are hiding Brett Kavanaugh's record from the American people.\"\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP\nThe documents released by Booker include a batch of emails concerning racial profiling, affirmative action and other race-conscious government programs.\nIn a 2002 email, Kavanaugh wrote that security procedures adopted in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks should ultimately be race-neutral, though he acknowledged that developing such procedures could take time. Others in the White House suggested racial profiling might be legally justified if it enhanced security.\nIn a 2001 email, Kavanaugh addressed a legal challenge to an affirmative action program within the Department of Transportation.\n\"The fundamental problem in this case is that these DOT regulations use a lot of legalisms and disguises to mask what in reality is a naked racial set-aside,\" he wrote.\nKavanaugh had sidestepped questions from Booker on Wednesday night about the circumstances in which government can and cannot use race-conscious measures to address past discrimination.\nHe conceded that hopes he expressed nearly two decades ago for a color-blind society have not been fulfilled.\n\"We see on an all-too-common basis that racism still exists in the United States of America,\" Kavanaugh said. \"Our long march to racial equality is not over.\"\nSeparately, The New York Times reported on leaked emails from the \"confidential\" file. One is an email drafted by Kavanaugh in 2003, in which he questioned whether the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion should be described as \"settled law of the land.\"\nPressed on that email by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., on Thursday, Kavanaugh explained he was simply summarizing views of legal scholars and not offering his own view.\nOn Wednesday, Kavanaugh said he understands the weight that many people attach to Roe. But he declined to say whether that case was properly decided.\nThroughout the hearing, Kavanaugh has avoided commenting on Trump's behavior, despite urging from Senate Democrats.\n\"I'm not going to get within three zip codes of a political controversy,\" he said Thursday, when Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asked him about Trump's attacks on judges, including Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\"I've spoken about my respect and appreciation for the eight justices on the Supreme Court,\" Kavanaugh said. \"I know they're all dedicated public servants who have given a great deal to this country.\"\nBarring surprises, Kavanaugh appears likely to win confirmation in time to take his place alongside those eight justices when the Supreme Court begins its fall term next month.\nNot seeing the video?

Jim Jordan's claim that he had no idea the wrestling team doctor was molesting athletes.\nOne of the wrestlers, Shawn Dailey, said he was groped half a dozen times by Dr. Richard Strauss in the mid-1990s, when Jordan was the assistant wrestling coach. Dailey said he was too embarrassed to report the abuse directly to Jordan at the time, but he said Jordan took part in conversations where Strauss' abuse of many other team members came up.\n\"I participated with Jimmy and the other wrestlers in locker-room talk about Strauss. We all did,\" Dailey, 43, told NBC News, referring to Jordan. \"It was very common knowledge in the locker room that if you went to Dr. Strauss for anything, you would have to pull your pants down.\"\nDailey spoke out two days after NBC News reported that three former wrestlers who were coached by Jordan more than two decades ago accused the GOP congressman of turning a blind eye to Strauss' alleged abuse and then lying about it. Jordan denied knowing anything about the abuse and continues to do so.\nDailey corroborated the account of one of those wrestlers, Dunyasha Yetts, who told NBC News that Yetts had protested to Jordan and head coach Russ Hellickson after Strauss tried to pull down his wrestling shorts when Yetts went to see him for a thumb injury.\n\"Dunyasha comes back and tells Jimmy, 'Seriously, why do I have to pull down my pants for a thumb injury?'\" Dailey recalled. \"Jimmy said something to the extent of, 'If he tried that with me, I would kill him.'\"\nCalling Jordan \"a close friend,\" Dailey said he is a Republican and that he contributed to the powerful Ohio congressman's first political campaign for state representative in 1994.\n\"What happened drove me out of the sport,\" said Dailey, a married father of two who works as a fundraiser for an Ohio college. \"So I was surprised to hear Jim say that he knew nothing about it.\"\n\"Jimmy's a good guy,\" Dailey added. \"But to say that he had no knowledge of it, I would say that's kind of hurtful.\"\nAlso Thursday, Mark Coleman, another former wrestler and a former UFC world champion, told The Wall Street Journal that Jordan was aware of the abuse and had not taken action. \"There's no way unless he's got dementia or something that he's got no recollection of what was going on at Ohio State,\" said Coleman, who said he was Jordan's roommate on several wrestling trips.\nJordan, via spokesman Ian Fury, has denied any knowledge of the abuse. On Wednesday, Jordan, a founder of the arch-conservative House Freedom Caucus, who has been floated to succeed retiring House Speaker Paul Ryan, repeated the denial in an interview with Politico.\n\"It's not true,\" said Jordan, who was assistant wrestling coach at the university from 1986 to 1994. \"I never knew about any type of abuse. If I did, I would have done something about it.\"\nFury did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday after Dailey's remarks.

His denials, however, have been met with skepticism and anger from some former members of the wrestling team.\nThree former wrestlers told NBC News that it was common knowledge that Strauss showered regularly with the students and inappropriately touched them during appointments, and said it would have been impossible for Jordan to be unaware; one wrestler said he told Jordan directly about the abuse.\nFormer head coach Russ Hellickson, Jordan's mentor, said in a recent video - made by Mike DiSabato, a former wrestler - that Hellickson had told Strauss that he was being too \"hands on\" with students.\nDiSabato, whose allegations against Strauss prompted Ohio State to open its investigation, called Jordan a \"liar.\"\n\"I considered Jim Jordan a friend,\" DiSabato said. \"But at the end of the day, he is absolutely lying if he says he doesn't know what was going on.\"\nDiSabato said he reached out to Jordan this year, before going to the university, to tell Jordan that he planned to go public with his allegations. Jordan told him to \"please leave me out of it,\" DiSabato said. \"He asked me not to get him involved.\"\n\"At the end of the day, he is absolutely lying if he says he doesn't know what was going on.\"\nDunyasha Yetts, who wrestled at Ohio State in 1993 and 1994, said he and others told Jordan about Strauss.\n\"I remember I had a thumb injury and went into Strauss' office and he started pulling down my wrestling shorts,\" he said. \"I'm like, what the f--- are you doing? And I went out and told Russ and Jim what happened. I was not having it. They went in and talked to Strauss.\"\nYetts said he and his teammates talked to Jordan numerous times about Strauss.\n\"For God's sake, Strauss's locker was right next to Jordan's and Jordan even said he'd kill him if he tried anything with him,\" Yetts said.\nYetts admitted that he did time for bilking investors out of nearly $2 million. \"I am not a perfect person, but ask any of the wrestlers and they will tell you everybody knew about Doc,\" said Yetts, who served 18 months in prison.\nAs for Jordan, Yetts said, \"He's a great guy. We would have all these great talks with him and he talked about how one day he'd be the president of the United States.\"\n\"So it's sad for me to hear that he's denying knowing about Strauss,\" he said. \"I don't know why he would, unless it's a cover-up. Either you're in on it, or you're a liar.\"\nA former teammate of DiSabato's who asked not to be identified said he never told Jordan directly that Strauss had abused him. But there is no way Jordan could have avoided the rumors \"because it was all over the locker room.\"\n\"I love Jimmy to death,\" the ex-wrestler said. \"It was a head-scratcher to me why he would say he didn't know anything. Doc used to take showers with the team even though he didn't do any workouts, and everybody used to snicker about how you go into his office for a sore shoulder and he tells you to take your pants down.\"\nWhen the first stories about the university investigation appeared this spring, Jordan told The Columbus Dispatch, \"I had not heard about any type of abuse at all.\" He also said that \"no one reported any type of abuse\" to him.\nAfter NBC News reached out to Jordan, the congressman's spokesman repeated the denial.\n\"Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State,\" his spokesman, Ian Fury, said in an email to NBC News.\nShortly after the NBC News story was published, Fury added the following statement: \"He has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask, because if what is alleged is true, the victims deserve a full investigation and justice.\"\nBut Kathleen Trafford of Porter Wright Morris & Arthur, the Dayton, Ohio-based law firm that was appointed as legal counsel to Ohio State, said in a statement that investigators \"had previously contacted Rep. Jordan's office by email and phone to request that he participate in an interview.\"\n\"To date, Rep. Jordan has not responded to those requests,\" Trafford wrote. \"The investigative team is continuing its efforts to schedule an interview with Rep. Jordan.\"\nJordan, a founder of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of the most conservative representatives, is a staunch ally of President Donald Trump and is frequently mentioned as a possible replacement for the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan.\nRyan, through his spokesman Doug Andres, also weighed in on the Ohio State investigation and Jordan's role.\n\"These are serious allegations and issues,\" Andres said. \"The university has rightfully initiated a full investigation into the matter. The speaker will await the findings of that inquiry.\"\nDiSabato forwarded to NBC News an email he sent on April 24 to Jordan and the congressman's brother, Jeff, who runs Jeff Jordan's State Champ Camp, a nationally known wrestling camp in Ohio. DiSabato sent the email 19 days after Ohio State announced on April 5 that it was investigating Strauss and the administrators of the wrestling program at the time, including the coaches, just as other colleges have done in similar circumstances.\nDiSabato was concerned that the university would ultimately sweep his allegations under the rug, and he wanted to ensure that Jordan would back him up.\n\"I ask you to give your full attention to the information attached to this email,\" DiSabato wrote. \"We [are] watching you. ... You have the platform to cut through the double talk, placation and finger pointing.\"\nJordan and his brother did not reply to the email, DiSabato said. Jeff Jordan said in an email that he'd never attended or worked at Ohio State University.\nRep. Jim Jordan speaks during a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill on June 28. Alex Wong / Getty Images\nJim Jordan, who has made a name for himself in Congress by grilling investigators probing alleged collusion by the Trump campaign with the Russians, is among the witnesses expected to be questioned by the law firm that Ohio State hired to conduct the probe into Strauss' misconduct, officials involved with the investigation said.\nIn the video that DiSabato made about the allegations against Strauss, which DiSabato sent to Ohio State in June, Hellickson, the former head wrestling coach, said he told school administrators about Strauss and also warned the doctor to steer clear of his wrestlers.\n\"I said, 'You make the guys nervous when you shower with them,'\" Hellickson said in the video. \"His response was, 'Coach, you shower with your guys all the time.' And I said, 'Not for an hour, Doc.'\"\nDiSabato and his former teammates said Jordan and Hellickson were close, and if the head coach had qualms about Strauss he would have shared them with his No. 2.\n\"Jim was Coach Russ' right-hand man,\" one former wrestler said.\nHellickson, an Olympics silver medalist in wrestling in 1976 who has done commentary from the games for NBC Sports, did not return calls for comment.\nIn response to a series of questions from NBC, Ohio State emailed a statement saying that the law firm Perkins Coie was overseeing the probe into the Strauss allegations for the university. OSU said it has also reached out \"to the Columbus Division of Police and the Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney's Office for any potential criminal investigation.\"\n\"To date, Perkins Coie has interviewed more than 150 former students and witnesses and is engaged in further investigative efforts,\" the university said in the statement. \"Ohio State has shared all additional information that has come to the attention of the university with the independent investigators whose work is ongoing.\"\nIt's unclear whether former Ohio State coaches or administrators could face any penalties from the university for not protecting wrestlers from Strauss.\n\"Our efforts will continue to be focused on uncovering what may have happened during this era, what university leaders at the time may have known, and whether any response at the time was appropriate,\" the university's statement said. \"Once the independent investigation has been completed, we will be in a position to consider what further action might be appropriate.\"\nJordan is wrestling royalty. Born and raised in Champaign County, Ohio, he was a four-time state wrestling champion. Competing for the University of Wisconsin-Madison, he won NCAA titles in 1985 and 1986.\nBut in the wrestling world, Jordan is best known for defeating future two-time Olympic gold medalist John Smith twice in an NCAA tournament in 1985.\nJordan returned home to Ohio and - while working as a coach - earned a master's degree in education at Ohio State and later a law degree from Capital University in Columbus before launching his political career in 1994 when he was elected to the Ohio General Assembly.\nA 1978 employment application information for Dr. Richard Strauss, from Ohio State University personnel files. Ohio State University via AP file\nStrauss signed on at Ohio State as an attending physician in September 1978 and served as a team physician in the athletics department from July 1981 to June 1995, according to the university's statement. He also worked as a part-time doctor in the university's student health department from July 1994 to August 1996.\nAfter resigning from the Ohio State medical staff in 1994, Strauss stayed on as an emeritus faculty member until he retired in July 1998 and moved from Columbus to Los Angeles, the university said.\nCiting Los Angeles County coroner records, The Columbus Dispatch reported that Strauss died of suicide in 2005 after struggling with pain and other health issues.\nStrauss' relatives have not spoken publicly about the allegations since they surfaced. NBC News was not able to reach any of his relatives.\nDiSabato, who runs a Columbus-based sports and entertainment agency called the Profectus Group, said the recent conviction of former Olympics gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar prompted him and other Ohio State athletes to come forward about Strauss.\nStrauss' primary job was to give wrestlers physicals, treat them for injuries and monitor their health, DiSabato said. He said Strauss also preyed on students who played other sports.\n\"Strauss sexually assaulted male athletes in at least fifteen varsity sports during his employment at OSU from 1978 through 1998,\" DiSabato wrote in a June 26 email to Kathleen M. Trafford of Porter Wright Morris & Arthur, the Columbus-based law firm that represents Ohio State. \"Athlete victims include members of the following programs: football, basketball, wrestling, swimming, cheerleading, volleyball, lacrosse, gymnastics, ice hockey, soccer, baseball, tennis, track and cross country.\"\nChillingly, DiSabato added: \"Based on testimony from victim athletes from each of the aforementioned varsity sports, we estimate that Strauss sexually assaulted and/or raped a minimum of 1,500/2,000 athletes at OSU from 1978 through 1998.\"\nOhio State has confirmed that investigators have received \"confidential reports of sexual misconduct committed by Strauss\" from former athletes in 14 sports and from former patients in Student Health Services.\nIn the video, DiSabato said Strauss knew that many of the athletes were small-town kids who weren't likely to protest if the doctor told them to disrobe, for fear of losing their scholarships. He said coaches knew that Strauss was a predator.\n\"Everybody knew before you were going into the [examination] room that Doc Strauss was going to touch you,\" DiSabato said. \"It was like a joke before you went in there.\"\nStrauss wasn't the only Ohio State official who showered with the team, DiSabato said. After practice ended at 3:30 p.m., some university professors, administrators and others would show up in the shower stalls just as the athletes were arriving, he said.\nIt was, DiSabato said, like walking through \"the gauntlet of sexual deviancy.\"\nAnother former wrestler whose testimony appears on the video DiSabato submitted to investigators described how Strauss grabbed his penis during an examination.\n\"I didn't do a thing,\" he said when asked how he responded. \"Probably, because I was scared.\"\nHe broke down when asked why, after all these years, he was speaking out.\n\"Why am I doing this now? It's just hard,\" he said. \"I don't want this to ever have to happen to anybody else, ever ... at The Ohio State University or any school.\""], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "164, 376", "docSpanText": "Jim Jordan, the powerful Republican congressman from Ohio, is being accused by former wrestlers he coached more than two decades ago at Ohio State University of failing to stop the team doctor from molesting them"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "595, 601;674, 722;777, 801", "docSpanText": "Jordan<SPAN_SEP>has repeatedly said he knew nothing of the abuse<SPAN_SEP>and continued to deny it"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "3627, 3746", "docSpanText": "everybody used to snicker about how you go into his office for a sore shoulder and he tells you to take your pants down"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "3198, 3422", "docSpanText": "A former teammate of DiSabato's who asked not to be identified said he never told Jordan directly that Strauss had abused him.

Dailey specifically backs up the account of former teammate Dunyasha Yetts, saying Jordan's reply to Yetts after Yetts complained about Strauss was: \"If he tried that with me, I would kill him.\" Dailey notes he's a Republican, like Jordan, whom he calls a \"close friend\" and \"good guy\" whose campaign he donated to in 1994.

Simpson that for a little while filled TV screens across America on Thursday.\nA Nevada parole board decided Simpson should be freed after the former NFL star apologized for his role in a 2007 armed robbery, said he'd been a model prisoner, and promised that he'd have no conflicts if released.\nSimpson's appearance before the board garnered wall-to-wall coverage from cable news shows, coverage that recalled the \"trial of the century,\" and the many months more than 20 years ago when it transfixed a nation.\n\"I've done my time,\" Simpson said. \"I've done it as well and as respectfully as I think anyone can.\"\nNow 70, Simpson's energy seemed little affected by his time behind bars. He was alert, engaged, and quick to smile, even letting out a hearty laugh when parole board Chairman Connie Bisbee accidentally said he was aged 90. \"I feel like it,\" he said.\nSimpson has served nine years of a nine-to-33-year sentence for an armed robbery and kidnapping in Las Vegas. He is expected to be released as early as October -- and said he plans to move to his home in Florida.\nAn entire generation of Americans has come of age since Simpson seemed an almost inescapable public figure. But for one afternoon, it felt like 1995 again.\nThat was the year he was acquitted of murder charges in the grisly slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.\nThursday's parole hearing followed renewed interest in his story, which was explored last year in the award-winning documentary \"O.J.: Made in America\" and the FX true-crime drama \"The People v. O.J. Simpson.\"\nThough it's been 22 years since the not guilty verdict, the murder trial's themes of criminal justice and race, trust in police, celebrity and domestic violence remain remarkably resonant in modern culture. \"We talk about O.J. as though the story is O.J.,\" journalist Celia Farber says toward the end of the \"Made in America\" documentary. \"The story is O.J. and us.\"\nParole board vote unanimous\nFor his part, Simpson seemed remarkably unaltered. He repeatedly avoided taking full responsibility for the Vegas crime.\nAt one point, he said he had lived a \"conflict-free life,\" a statement that perhaps bemused anyone whose memory stretches back more than two decades.\n\"Juice,\" as he was known in his heyday, said associates misled him during the Vegas robbery and then turned on him in court.\nOne of those associates is Tom Riccio. Simpson testified that Riccio is the one who called him, persuading him to take part in the robbery. Simpson said Thursday he regretted ever taking Riccio's call.\nBut, according to Riccio, Simpson did a lot more than that.\n\"He should wish he didn't make all those calls after my call,\" Riccio told CNN. \"After he took my call he did a lot of things he shouldn't have done.\"\nRiccio added that Simpson was the one who orchestrated the robbery.\n\"He plotted it all and gathered up men with guns.\"\nSimpson said Riccio avoided punishment by throwing him under the bus.\n\"Unfortunately, they got a get-out-of-jail-free card when they said 'O.J. told me (to do it),'\" Simpson said. \"Nothing I can do about that.\"\nSufficient remorse is not a relevant factor for parole, and Simpson ticked off several mitigating factors that made him a good candidate for release. He was discipline-free in prison, he has stable release plans, he has family and community support -- and, of course, he has no prior criminal convictions.\nThe four parole board members voted unanimously to grant him parole, and board member Tony Corda said he was graded a \"low risk to reoffend.\"\nSimpson smiled, said \"thank you,\" and then put his head down for a few moments silently.\nO.J.

I am sorry that things turned out the way they did. I had no intent to commit a crime.\"\nThe parole hearing featured testimony from Arnelle Simpson, the former football great's oldest daughter, who said her father was \"my best friend and my rock.\"\nSimpson also said he has taken two \"Alternative to Violence\" classes, which he said was \"the most important course any person in this prison can take.\"\nIn addition, robbery victim Bruce Fromong testified that he had forgiven Simpson for the crime at that Las Vegas hotel room, and advocated for his release.\nSimpson had also been described by authorities as a model prisoner at Lovelock Correctional Center, a medium-security prison in the Nevada desert.\nThe robbery\nSimpson and an associate were convicted of kidnapping, armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon for attempting to steal pieces of Simpson sports memorabilia at gunpoint.\nAt his 2008 sentencing, the Hall of Fame running back said he went to the room in the Palace Station Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas to reclaim family heirlooms and other personal items that had been taken from him. He also claimed he didn't know his associates were armed.\n\"I wasn't there to hurt anybody,\" Simpson said. \"I just wanted my personal things, and I realize now that was stupid of me.

His 2008 conviction came 13 years after his acquittal on murder charges in the deaths of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. Hide Caption 23 of 23\nSimpson's legal team argued that the nine-to-33-year sentence did not match the crime and that it was, in fact, a form of payback for his controversial acquittal in the deaths of Brown and Goldman. Even Bruce Fromong, a victim in the robbery, agreed.\n\"It wasn't about justice,\" Fromong said in \"O.J.: Made in America.\" \"They wanted the guy that got away with murder in 1994.\"\nSimpson has always denied he killed Brown and Goldman. Their families won a wrongful death civil judgment against him in 1997.\nAt a parole hearing in 2013, Simpson said he regretted the Las Vegas kidnapping and robbery.\n\"I just wish I had never gone to that room. I wish I had just said, 'Keep it,' and not worry about it,\" he said. ", " These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

A hearing is underway at which he is trying to convince members of the Nevada Board of Parole that he should go free. \"I haven't made any excuses in the nine years that I've been here and I'm not trying to make an excuse now,\" said the 70-year-old Simpson early in the proceedings, per the AP. Later, he added, \"I am sorry that things turned out the way they did. I had no intent to commit a crime.\" He also appeared to stifle a sob in his appeal to the board. Simpson has been imprisoned since 2008 over an armed robbery and kidnapping case, but he and many legal analysts think that the board will vote to release him. If so, he's expected to be out on Oct. 1. The televised hearing is being livestreamed at various sites, including CNN. Per CNN, one of the first questions posed to Simpson by a board member in regard to the robbery, in which he and other men entered a Vegas hotel room to reclaim sports memorabilia, was, \"What were you thinking?\" Simpson called it a \"big mistake\" and emphasized that he wasn't armed. \"I would never pull a gun on anybody.\" He insisted that he learned only afterward that one of the men with him, who was \"behind me,\" brandished a gun. Another board member noted that he hadn't taken an alcohol-abuse program as he promised he would at his last hearing. Other Simpson quotes: \"I'm at a point in my life where all I want to do is spend as much time with my children.\" \"I've basically spent a conflict-free life.\" Daughter Arnelle Simpson said her father is \"remorseful,\" and she wants him to come home so they can \"move forward,\" adding, \"It's been hard.\""}, "test79": {"documents": ["We've got all the latest developments in the death of Julia Roberts' half-sister Nancy Motes, including a reaction from her fiance John Dilbeck, and a look at the lurking conflict between her grieving partner and surviving family members.\nAs we previously reported, Moats was found dead at 37 Sunday in what officials indicated was a suicide via overdose, with Los Angeles County Coroner's Assistant Chief Ed Winter confirming to Yahoo! that numerous \"notes [were] found at the scene,\" as well as \"both prescription and nonprescription pills.\" (Toxicology tests remain pending in Moats' death, Winter said, adding the results could take up to 10 weeks.)\nPHOTOS: Stars Who OD'd\nOn Wednesday, MailOnline.com that caught up with Dilbeck as he ran errands in Santa Monica, Calif; asked if he thought Motes was a drug addict, he shook his head sideways, gesturing, \"No.\"\nWhen the outlet asked Dilbeck if he'd been in touch with the Pretty Woman star, amidst reports of serious dissension between his camp and his late fiance's family, he said he had \"no comment at this time.\"\nWhile Dibeck wasn't talking, a source close to the situation told the NY Post that he'll be pushing to keep Moats' belongings as the sole beneficiary of her estate, which would have implications involving the Oscar-winner.\nPHOTOS: Hollywood Bodyguards Tell All - Who Steals, Sexts, Does Drugs & More Star Secrets Revealed\n\"If Nancy had photos and wrote a diary, describing her feelings towards her sister, he could use them,\" the source said. \"There is a fear that John could be holding Nancy's personal items hostage and possibly sell them to the highest bidder.\n\"While Nancy wasn't a wealthy woman, she would have had gifts given to her by Julia, as well as intimate family pictures.\"\nThe source said that longstanding hard feelings between Dilbeck and Moats' relatives stemmed from the fact that Roberts and their mother, Betty Lou Motes, \"felt that he was a bad influence on\" Nancy.\nPHOTOS: Hollywood Bodyguards Tell All - Who Steals, Sexts, Does Drugs & More Star Secrets Revealed\n\"Julia and her mother had tried for a long time, for years, to get Nancy to go into rehab, and she repeatedly refused,\" the source told the paper. \"They did not approve of John ... but you can't tell someone of Nancy's age whom not to date.\"\nOn Tuesday, Dilbeck's brother Connor publicly chided Moats' family for their treatment of the late dog walker, and said he believed that the late woman timed her suicide to put a dent in Roberts' Oscar chances next month.

Their power can be destroyed very easily if unfortunate things make them look more wicked.\n'They have to be careful, it can destroy their career or their Academy Award.'\nThe insight into Nancy's life comes as RadarOnline reported that the 37-year-old who worked as a production worker on Glee was battling drug addiction and Julia had tried to save her numerous times by getting her to go to rehab.\nAuthorities recovered both prescription and non-prescription drugs at the Los Angeles home.\n'Julia tried in vain over the years, even in the last six months, to get Nancy to go to rehab,' a source close to Julia reportedly told RadarOnline.\n'Nancy refused the offers and that is when she would often publicly lash out at Julia. It hurt Julia, but she knew her sister was battling addiction.'\nThe sisters' relationship became even more rocky after Nancy blasted Julia to Britain's Sun newspaper last August. She also gave a bruising interview to the New York Daily News.\nTragic: Julia Roberts' half-sister Nancy Motes killed herself in a desperate attempt to destroy the actress' career and scupper her chances of winning an Oscar at this year's Academy Awards, Conner Dilbeck, pictured, has claimed in an exclusive interview with MailOnline\nBusy woman: Roberts has been working the awards circuit for her turn in August: Osage County, which she did here on January 18 while attending the Screen Actors Guild Awards\nPlea: Conner wrote about his brother's fiance and Nancy's troubles with Julia Roberts on his Facebook page along with a photo of when John Dilbeck proposed\nAccording to Page Six, the Hollywood star was 'mortified' by the 'embarrassing' stories and wondered if her cash-strapped sister had betrayed her by selling the juicy details to the UK tabloid for money.\n\nIt's not clear if Nancy was in fact paid by The Sun for the interview.\nHowever, Conner told MailOnline Julia inflicted 'pure cruelty' on her sister and Nancy's suicide letter was a desperate attempt to expose the alleged treatment.\nAnd a friend and neighbor of Nancy Motes told MailOnline that her death was 'not a Philip Seymour Hoffman thing' but a planned suicide.\n\nConner claimed the note is eight pages long - not five as had been thought - and Julia is said to be 'terrified' about it coming out.\nConner also revealed that John Dilbeck was overcome by the 'horror' of seeing his fiance's lifeless body in the bath.\nIn a Facebook post Conner wrote: 'Nancy wanted the Truth to come out and she was Willing to Die to get her point across.'\nConner, 40, lived with Nancy and John in their apartment in Santa Monica, California for years, during which time he saw their relationship blossom.\nBut the dark side was that he claimed it gave him a front row seat to the he mistreatment he claims Nancy suffered at the hands of Julia.\nWatch the full interview on Inside Edition\n\n\n\n Emotional: Nancy Motes appeared to post aggressive messages onto her Twitter account in the weeks prior to her tragic death apparently attacking her half-sister Julia Roberts\nConner said: 'I have spent enough time with Nancy and I know enough about her that I can say from first hand experience a lot of things that have happened.'\nHe added: 'The truth is in the eight pages of her suicide letter.'\nIn a series of furious posts on Facebook, Conner railed against Julia and squarely blamed her for the tragedy.\nHe wrote: 'I am posting this as a plea to everyone to Pray for my Brother John.\n'His lovely Fiance, Nancy Motes, was driven to Take her Life yesterday because of the Pure Cruelty of her Sister, Julia Roberts (yes Ms. Pretty Woman herself), that has done everything in her power to Ruin her and my brothers lives.\n'He is overwhelmed by this horrible event and all the Turmoil Julia has subjected them too.' Speaking to MailOnline, Conner said that after his brother found his fiance's body last Sunday he called the police and then called his family in distress. Breaking into tears, he said: 'The one thing that has made it more emotional for our family than anything else is to think of the horror of my brother having to walk in their and find his dead love in the water and nothing he could do about it and how she was driven to do this.'\nOscars: Nancy Motes killed herself to scupper her sister's Oscar chances, it has been claimed. Roberts, left, stars in the film with Meryl Streep, center In the months before her death, Nancy took aim at her famous sister on Twitter and one particular tweet apparently gives weight to the claim that she was plotting to hurt the Notting Hill star in some way. Nancy's death hasn't officially been ruled a suicide as a toxicology report has not been completed but her the family said in a statement that she died of 'an apparent drug overdose.' In December, an emotional Nancy mysteriously tweeted, apparently about Julia: 'Hey Hag! Glad you f****ed with me yet? You're going to LOVE what's coming! FYI-You're an awful, hate filled old pathetic excuse for a human.'\nConner's account comes after John Fraschetti, who also knows Nancy's grieving fiance, claimed the family of the Oscar winner were now 'crying crocodile tears' over the former Glee production worker's death. He said they are only interested in manipulating public opinion after her suicide, but during her life, 'drove her to death.' Making the incendiary comments Tuesday outside Nancy and Dilbeck's home, Fraschetti said Nancy spiraled into depression after Betty Lou Motes, the mother she and Roberts shared, 'rejected' her six months ago - and that she 'just couldn't handle it anymore'. 'And then you get the actress woman who is pretending to grieve but she didn't want to deal with Nancy and made her f***ing miserable.' Nancy Motes was found dead on Sunday in a bathtub filled with water with prescription and 'illegal drugs' near her in an apparent suicide. Fraschetti claims to have seen the letter she left behind.\nFraschetti, who has known Dilbeck since he was 13, said that since her death, her family have been careful to mold a favorable public reaction. 'They are crying crocodile tears. They have taken control of this situation, but they never cared of her when she was alive,' said Fraschetti. Fraschetti said that Nancy, 'couldn't stand the rejection of her mom, who in the last six months had cut her off entirely.' Upset: Julia Roberts' mother Betty Lou Motes is seen leaving her home in Los Angeles looking frail and upset Tuesday afternoon Cut-off: Nancy Motes is pictured in this photo with Julia Roberts when the Oscar winning actress was around 22 years old\n'It hurt her that none of her family wanted to be with her. She had a miserable Christmas, truly awful, and I think she just couldn't handle it anymore.'\nFraschetti admitted that Nancy's well-documented problems with drugs and her weight had caused divisions, but claimed that to cut her off was unforgivable.\n'They didn't care when she was alive. She was a handful, and yes she had her problems, but there's a way to deal with your relatives,' said an angry Fraschetti.\nNancy's suicide note also reveals the true depths of depression that her family's rejection had sent her to.\n'It read about how much she loved and cared for her fiance and how happy he made her, but it also said how unhappy and depressed her family made her and how she couldn't cope anymore,' said Fraschetti, who said that fiance, Dilbeck, is grief stricken by Nancy's death and can't face the media.\nIndicating that the suicide note goes into detail about how hurt she felt by being ignored, Fraschetti said that Roberts and her family even put pressure on Dilbeck to delete tweets.\nBut, it was revealed last night that Nancy had apparently tweeted a string of vicious messages aimed at her Oscar winning sister, including 'Just so you all know \"America's Sweetheart\" is a B****!!' on January 20.\nThat and others were indeed deleted overnight.\n\nFriend: John Fraschetti has known Nancy Motes' fiance John Dilbeck since he was 13 and says that Julia Roberts and her family cutting off Nancy caused her suicide\n'We've got a person who is grieving so much, but then there is the other so called family who are grieving, so to speak, who want to see as little grief as possible for them,' said Fraschetti.\n'It's the rich versus the poor, the fake versus the real, he's the one who's in agony, he's the one that's genuine.'\nAnd in an apparent confirmation that she did indeed commit suicide, Fraschetti said that her death was planned, but that she didn't use heroin like Philip Seymour Hoffman.\nShe wasn't into heroin, as far as I was aware. It's not like her or John were heroin addicts. Come on, it's ridiculous.\n'I wouldn't read too much into where she did it, it wasn't in some drug den. She was dog sitting, and I imagine she did this, so she didn't have to do it at home and let John find her.'\nAnd this afternoon, Julia Roberts' grief-stricken mother looked frail and visibly shaken as she visited the Oscar-winner following the apparent suicide death of her younger daughter, Nancy Motes.\n\nDressed in a tartan hat and black jacket, Betty Lou Motes was driven by a friend from her home in Pacific Palisades to Julia's mansion in Malibu.\nThe visit came after it was reported that Nancy left a five page suicide note in which she accused her famous sibling of driving her to kill herself.\nHer fiance discovered her body, which had been dead as long as 12 hours, but a responding EMT worker recovered the extensive letter, according to the New York Daily News.\nIn the note, Nancy dedicated three pages to her tortured relationship with the Pretty Woman actress, the Daily News quoted a source close to the investigation as saying.\nGone too soon: Nancy Motes, pictured in August (left), died on Sunday from an apparent drug overdose; she is the half-sister of Julia Roberts (right)\nRage: Nancy Motes, tweeted under her husband-to-be's last name online. This vitriolic attack is believed to be against her half-sister, Julia Roberts and happened a little more than a month before she died\nPain: Nancy Motes is also believed to have launched these attacks on the star of Pretty Woman and Mystic Pizza - calling her cruel and blaming her for causing her rage despite her best efforts to remain calm\nSad: Nancy Motes posted these bittersweet tweets in October - in which she laments that she is having to leave her family to find the love she craves from another\n'It was definitely a suicide. She left a five-page suicide letter. The EMT found it,' the source told the Daily News.\n'There were three pages of rantings that her sister drove her to do this. There was one page to her mom, telling her how much she loved her, and one page apologizing to (her fiance).'\nNancy and Dilbeck were scheduled to be married in May, but the Georgia native seemed to be unraveling recently.\nOn Twitter, she sounded decidedly unstable, lashing out at Julia, whom she claims bullied her about her weight when they were growing up. 'So my \"sister\" said that with all her friends & fans she doesn't need any more love. Just so you all know \"America's Sweetheart\" is a B****!!' she tweeted on January 20, referring to Roberts. 'Do you want to be a fan of someone so cruel? She's not even that good of an actress. Happy you totally F***ed with me?' she added in a subsequent tweet before claiming she'd never been more angry. 'I must admit I maybe going to far... But I never been so angry in my life. I'm actually a pretty easygoing, peaceful person.'\n'(M)y own family has abandoned me,' she tweeted January 22. Three weeks later, she was dead.\nThe emotional comments, seen on the Twitter handle @Dabbs76, had been deleted by Tuesday morning.\nFamily: Roberts with Motes and their mother Betty Lou when the star was filming 1997's My Best Friend's Wedding\nThe most recent Twitter outburst followed similar rants late last year.\nFor example, Nancy had written previously of her family abandoning her.\n'Feeling blessed, even though I'm sick as a dog! I'm very grateful that I have my loves family, since my own family has abandoned me,' she tweeted, referring to her new partner.\n\nHer next tweets also appeared to be angrily directed at the Notting Hill star.\n\nShe tweeted: 'Hey Hag! Glad you f****ed with me yet? You're going to LOVE what's coming! FYI-You're an awful, hate filled old pathetic excuse for a human.\n\n'I must be grateful & not hateful. I must forgive. But Damn that is a REALLY hard thing to do sometimes, right?!?!'\nBack on December 19, Nancy also sounded depressed. She wrote: 'I must remember how blessed I am even in this very low point in my life. I want ALL of my family to have an awesome magical Christmas! '\n\nAnd on December 15 she tweeted: 'Must remember to stay strong. Life is a fight. You have to stay in it.'\n\nBack in October Nancy also spoke about her family rift, tweeting: 'It's a shame when you get more support from strangers than you do from your family. I can't wait to officially belong to another family!'\nShe also wrote that she was getting support from her and Julia's mother Betty, writing: 'So glad to have the support & love of my friends & mom!\n\nStill a smashing success: At 46, Roberts is more in demand than ever; here she leaves a talk about her Meryl Streep drama on February 4\nNancy last tweeted on Saturday, the day before she was found dead in the bathtub.\n\nShe wrote: 'Hope everyone is enjoying their Saturdays & watching East Los High! Season 3 coming soon!'\n\nNancy joined twitter last August and had 69 followers.\n\nShe posted several happy photos with her fiance John Dilbeck who she was due to marry on May 17.\nNancy had been tweeting excitedly about the big day, on October 21 she wrote: 'I found my beautiful shoes for my wedding day! And anyone that wants to bring me down during all the planning I have to do can kiss my ass!'\n\nOn October 3 she tweeted a photo of them together, writing: 'YAY! Wedding Venue found! Wedding dress found! Things are truly happening! It's all soooo exciting! I love him!'\nSince her tormented tweets were made public overnight, they key sections have been deleted.\n\nOn Monday, her family confirmed to People the 37-year-old had passed away in what appears to be an overdose.\n\nOn top: The actress on the February cover of Vanity Fair, on stands now\n'It is with deep sadness that the family of Nancy Motes ... confirms that she was found dead in Los Angeles yesterday of an apparent drug overdose,' the statement read. 'There is no official report from the Coroner's office yet. The family is both shocked and devastated.'\n\nShe was discovered in the bathtub of a home by her fiance John Dilbeck and pronounced dead at 2:12 p.m., a spokesman for the Los Angeles Coroner's Office told MailOnline.\nIt is believed she was found at a house where she was pet-sitting for a friend.\nToday, Ed Winter, assistant chief at the LA County Coroner's Office, said: 'The autopsy has been completed and the cause of death has been deferred depending on the toxicology reports. This can take between six and eight weeks.\n\n'A number of prescription medications were found in the bathroom area as were illegal drugs. We are still investigating whether they were hers or not. We're not releasing what illegal drugs they were.\n\n'It could be a possible suicide, but we don't know the cause of death yet for sure, which is depending on further investigation. It's more complicated as she also had some medical issues, so we're not sure what happened at the moment.\n\n'We are not being specific what those issues are, but it could mean a number of reasons for her death, she could have been taking a bath and had a heart attack. We just don't know at this stage.'\nJulia's rep did not return calls to MailOnline. The actress cancelled an appearance at an Academy Awards luncheon on Monday.\n\nNancy was an aspiring actress who had worked as a production assistant on TV's Glee.\n\nJulia and Nancy had the same mother, Betty Lou, but different fathers: Nancy's dad was Michael Motes and Julia's is the late Walter Grady Roberts.\n\nIn August the blonde had complained about growing up in the shadow of the Pretty Woman star, who has been working the awards circuit this year for her turn in August: Osage County with Meryl Streep.\nThinner: Nancy Motes looked considerably thinner in August 2013 as she grabbed coffee near her home in Santa Monica\nThe younger sibling had said she was known as Julia's 'fat little sister' and said the Oscar-winner had taunted her about her weight, leading her to undergo weight loss surgery in June 2012.\n\nRoberts, 46, made her feel embarrassed and ashamed of her weight, according to Nancy, which peaked at 20st.\n\nShe resorted to a f20,000 gastric bypass operation last year.\n\n'It makes me feel incredibly hurt and very sad,' Motes said. 'When you're in a family of very, very exceptionally beautiful people it's intimidating.'\n\nHer other siblings include Eric Roberts, 57, and Lisa Roberts Gillan, 48, who are also actors.\n\nActress Emma Roberts is the daughter of Eric.\n\n'I think that growing up as Pretty Woman's little sister has definitely made me try to see the person inside and not the person outside,' she added. 'A lot of my life I felt judged for my weight.'\nMotes, who grew up in the US state of Georgia, was only 13 when Roberts shot to Hollywood fame as hooker Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman.\n\nThe actress, who had won a Golden Globe for playing a young bride in Steel Magnolias, received a second for Pretty Woman.\n\nMotes, who described herself as an 'awkward' child who was bullied at school, could not compete with the success of her 'very pretty and very popular' sister.\n\nShe said: 'When I was in high school and she was an adult, she would just let me know that I was definitely overweight. She would make it quite clear to me and in a not so nice manner.\n\n'Julia did not want to see me go down that path [of acting] ...

They used to be very close when they were younger. Julia tried in vain over the years, even in the last six months, to get Nancy to go to rehab.

Treasury has advised that tobacco clearances fell by 3.4% in the 2013 calendar year relative to the 2012 calendar year and fell a further 7.9% in the 2014 calendar year. As at the end of 2014, tobacco clearances had fallen a total of 11.0% since 2012.These tobacco clearance rates do not take into account refunds of excise equivalent customs duty made under Customs' plain packaging related Tobacco Refund Scheme between December 2012 and May 2013. These refunds cannot be related to annual net clearances on a comparable basis to other data used to derive tobacco clearance rates.The tobacco excise rate was indexed to average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) from 1 March 2014 and there have been three of four 12.5% increases in the tobacco excise rate (1 December 2013, 1 September 2014, 1 September 2015) implemented. The next 12.5% increase will occur on 1 September 2016.As part of Health initiatives announced in the 2016 Budget, the Australian Government is reducing the allowable amount of duty free tobacco for travellers arriving in Australia.From 1 July 2017, travellers aged 18 years and over can only bring 25 grams of duty free tobacco, plus one open packet, into Australia. The tobacco can be in any form (cigarette, loose leaf and so on) and is equivalent to approximately 25 cigarettes.If you have more than this amount, you will be required to pay duty on all tobacco in your possession, unless you agree to dispose of the excess.Please ensure you are familiar with duty free limits when travelling to Australia.For more information on duty free limits, as well as what you can and cannot bring to Australia visit the Duty free concession page on the Department of Immigration and Boarder Protection website.There are a number of sources the Government relies on to monitor smoking rates, including data from national surveys conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), and drug and alcohol information collected nationally from secondary school students by the Cancer Council Victoria.On 28 April 2016, the ABS released the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey, 2014-15.The survey was conducted from September 2014 to June 2015 with a sample of 11,178 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in private dwellings across Australia. The report shows that in 2014-15:On 8 December 2015, the ABS released the National Health Survey: First Results 2014-15.The survey was conducted in all states and territories and across urban, rural and remote areas of Australia (other than very remote areas) from July 2014 to June 2015, and included around 19,000 people in nearly 15,000 private dwellings. The report shows that in 2014-15:On 24 November 2015, the Cancer Council Victoria released the 2014 Australian secondary school students' use of tobacco report.The survey included over 23,000 secondary aged students aged between 12 and 17 years of age during months of June to December of the 2014 academic school year. The report shows that in 2014:On 25 November 2014, the AIHW released the 2013 National Drug Strategy Household Survey detailed report (2013 NDSHS).The survey collected data from 23,855 people across Australia aged 12 years and over living in private dwellings. The report shows that in 2013:Other 2013 NDSHS findings included:The 2013 NDSHS results do not reflect any impact from the Australian Government's 1 March 2014 change to bi-annual indexation of tobacco excise or the first of four 12.5% excise increases on tobacco products which took effect on 1 December 2013.Australia's low smoking rate is the result of sustained, concerted and comprehensive public policy efforts from all levels of government and action from public health organisations.Further information on the impact of tobacco plain packaging in Australia is available on the Evaluation of Tobacco Plain Packaging in Australia page ", " Tweet with a location\nYou can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

The agency asked Australian smokers about colors they found unappealing and overwhelming.

According to Angela Wright, a color consultant and author of \"The Beginner's Guide to Colour Psychology,\" the technique has been around for decades.\nShe cites American color consultant Faber Birren, who in the 1960s devised a way to stop department store employees from taking lengthy bathroom breaks.\n\"The company asked him, 'Can you improve the working area so they don't have to leave all the time and use the restrooms?' \" Wright said.\n\"Birren actually took a different view and painted the restrooms in a color similar to Pantone 448C. And nobody wanted to spend time in the restrooms after that.\"\nThis is just one of the many examples that the \"world's ugliest color\" has been used to minimize appeal to control human behavior.\nIs Pantone 448C really that bad?\nWhat makes Pantone 448C so off-putting? Wright said she believes it's the association with human waste.\n\"It makes perfect sense that smoking packets would use a vile green that looks like bodily fluids and makes people feel slightly nauseated,\" she said.\nBut not everyone agrees.\nFrance will also introduce plain cigarette packaging.\n\"I actually quite like the color,\" said psychologist Dr. Carolyn Mair of the London College of Fashion, UAL. \"It's an earthy, muted, rich color, very much of nature. But then I also don't smoke.\"\nColor in advertising\nThe use of color can play a key role in brand perception among the public.\n\"Blue is often used in services such as banking and law because of its association with loyalty, honesty and reliability,\" Mair said. Red meanwhile \"raises the pulse rate ... and communicates strength and high energy,\" Wright said.\nColor associations Red: Strength, energy, passion Blue: Focus, loyalty, calmness Yellow: Ego, optimism, openness Green: Balance, youth, eco-friendly Purple: Luxury, femininity, glamour Sources: Angela Wright, Carolyn Mair\n\"Football teams who have red uniforms are giving themselves more physical energy but also communicating to the opposite team that they are powerful and strong.\"\nAnd purple has connotations with luxury, Mair said.\n\"Think of Cadbury chocolate (which has a purple logo). At least when it started out, it had the association with a glamorous, smooth, feminine brand,\" she added.\nColor combinations can also have powerful connotations.\nIn the UK, the Esso petrol logo features red, white and blue -- much like many national flags, including those of the United States, Great Britain and France.\n\"So this combination can result in an instinctive loyalty,\" Wright said.\nThe eye of the beholder\nThat said, perception also plays a huge role -- as seen in Wright's and Mair's different responses to Pantone 448C.\n\"Red could be seen as aggressive and demanding -- or as exhilarating and exciting,\" Wright said. \"Similarly, blue could be perceived as calming and well-thought-through -- or excessively bureaucratic and emotionless.\"\nWright sees the overwhelming color of our times as a bleak gray.\n\"Gray is the color of austerity,\" Wright said. \"And we're going to keep wearing gray until we feel better financially.\"\nThat is, unless you feel compelled to lighten things with a splash of Pantone 448C.

been used to try to save lives ever since. Per the Guardian, GfK surveyed 1,000 smokers back then to find out which hue turned them off the most, and this Pantone pick-a greenish-brown blend that survey participants said reminded them of \"death\" and \"tar\"-emerged the winner. Time notes the agency had been commissioned by the Australian government to find a color so repellent it could be used on cigarette packaging to discourage people from lighting up. The new color was found to have the most ability to \"minimize appeal\" and \"maximize perceived harm\" and was implemented on plain cigarette packs with health warnings across Australia, the Brisbane Times reported at the time. Early results are now in, and it appears the color that CNN describes as \"sludge-like\" may have made an impact: Cigarette sales have fallen, and now other countries such as the UK, France, and Ireland are following suit, per Metro. So what is it about the color that makes it such an effective sales deterrent? A color consultant tells CNN it may be the strong resemblance to, well, poop. But not everyone's on board with trashing opaque couche. Pantone sniffs to the Guardian, \"At the Pantone Color Institute, we consider all colors equally,\" noting that the color's \"deep, rich earth tones\" make it a oft-chosen pick for sofas.

Back in 2013, El Moussa visited a doctor about a lump that had appeared on his neck, but he was told it was benign. Then Ryan Read, a fan and trained nurse, spotted the growth while watching an episode. \"This is not a joke. I'm a registered nurse. I've been watching Flip or Flop. I noticed that the host Tarek has a large nodule on his thyroid, and he needs to have it checked out,\" she told the show's production company in an email, per the Independent. That email prompted El Moussa, then 31, to get a biopsy, which found he had thyroid cancer and that it had spread to his lymph nodes. El Moussa, who hosts Flip or Flop with his wife, Christina, says the pair got to meet Read when his case appeared on an episode of The Doctors. \"We actually ended up spending the day with her,\" he says, per Entertainment Tonight. \"It was just such an amazing experience to meet this person, because she stepped up and did what others probably wouldn't have done.\" He adds that without Read, he may never have known he had cancer, or \"by the time that I would've found out, it probably would've been in a much further stage.\" El Moussa had the tumor removed and underwent thyroid radioactive iodine therapy. Now \"I feel fantastic,\" he tells People. \"Every day that goes by, the odds of the cancer [recurring] decreases, so we're really excited for that.\" (This dog can also spot thyroid cancer.)"}, "test63": {"documents": ["After a freshman died from downing beer, rum and 151-proof liquor in an initiation ritual, California Polytechnic State University in 2010 banned fraternities from recruiting newly arrived students.\nRight away, the North-American Interfraternity Conference, which represents 75 national fraternities, jumped in. The Indianapolis-based trade group e-mailed and met with Cal Poly administrators, paid for a study that opposed the ban and spurred a three-year campaign by student leaders. It won, and the school lifted the restriction this year. One freshman, Charlie Ross, couldn't be happier about the opportunity to join a fraternity right away instead of waiting three months.\n\"You've got a group of guys who watch out for you when you're drinking,\" Ross, 18, said after unpacking his bags at freshman orientation on the San Luis Obispo campus.\nRelated Stories:\nThe university's turnabout shows how the Interfraternity Conference is blocking an approach that some higher education leaders say can save lives: postponing recruitment of freshmen, who account for a disproportionate number of fraternity-related deaths. The conference has opposed proposals at dozens of colleges to delay recruiting by a semester or a year.\n\"These organizations were putting our freshmen at risk,\" said Shirley Tilghman, former president of Princeton University, which prohibited fraternity recruiting of freshmen, starting in the fall of 2012. \"There is so much vulnerability in that first week, that first month as a freshman on a college campus -- of feeling lost. It leads to all kinds of decisions that you would not make if you had a little more time to find your way.\"\nFreshmen Deaths\nPrinceton students who belonged to fraternities, especially freshmen, were more likely to be hospitalized because of drinking, said Tilghman, who stepped down as president in June. Of 60 fraternity-related deaths nationwide since 2005, 24, or 40 percent, were of freshmen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nUniversities often are susceptible to the Interfraternity Conference's pressure to recruit freshmen because Greek life appeals to applicants and many alumni donors remain loyal to their fraternities. Only 80 of about 800 U.S. campuses with fraternities defer recruiting, according to the conference.\nFraternity membership surged to 327,260 in 2011 from 253,148 in 2005. National fraternities and affiliated foundations generated $185 million in student dues and other revenue in 2010-2011, up 24 percent from 2005-2006, tax records show.\nBinge Drinking\nWhite male fraternity members drink more heavily than any other group on campus, and published research suggests that the youngest students are most likely to engage in binge drinking, according to Aaron White, program director for college and underage drinking prevention research at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\n\"The first couple of months of school are a particularly vulnerable time for students with regard to heavy drinking,\" White said. \"Delaying rush makes a lot of sense.\"\nFounded in 1909, the Interfraternity Conference joined the industry's political arm, known as FratPAC, in fighting against a federal anti-hazing bill last year.\nThe group has stepped up advocacy on campuses, especially against recruiting restrictions. With its encouragement, fraternity leaders at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland rejected a 2011 plan to defer recruiting freshmen. At the University of Colorado at Boulder, the conference backed fraternities' decision to operate without university recognition, reducing their access to campus facilities, rather than accept deferred recruitment and live-in advisers.\nLawsuit Threat\n\"The NIC was not supportive\" of university rules, said Deb Coffin, Colorado vice chancellor for student affairs.\nThe University of Central Florida this year lifted a recruitment moratorium, which had been prompted by excessive drinking at fraternities and sororities, after the Interfraternity Conference threatened to sue the school for violating students' freedom-of-association rights. The national group's threat didn't influence the university, said Maribeth Ehasz, a Central Florida vice president.\nOf the 24 fraternity-related freshman deaths since 2005, 15 occurred during and after recruiting events, including hazing and initiation rituals.\nAt Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, freshman David Bogenberger died last year of alcohol poisoning after a fraternity initiation rite known as \"Mom and Dad's Night.\" With other pledges, Bogenberger moved from room to room at the chapter house answering questions from members and downing vodka before passing out, court records show.\nFraternity Measures\nFraternities have taken steps to protect students, including banning alcohol at recruiting events and supporting sanctions against violators, said Peter Smithhisler, president of the Interfraternity Conference.\nWhile drinking deaths at fraternities are \"heartbreaking,\" many students drink too much, not just at fraternities, he said. Keeping out freshmen merely puts a \"Band-Aid\" on a broader campus problem, he said. It also deprives freshmen of opportunities at fraternities for leadership, career networking and charitable work, he said.\n\"It would be a travesty if the fraternity experience were not available for the development of these young men,\" Smithhisler said. \"We believe in the fraternity experience and its ability to really transform an undergraduate into better men, better citizens, better doctors, teachers, engineers.\"\nFraternities' Lifeblood\nIf colleges are allowed to restrict recruitment for a semester or a year, they could next extend the delay through sophomore year, or even shut down fraternities, as some liberal arts institutions have done, he said.\n\"Recruitment is the lifeblood for every chapter,\" Smithhisler said.\nCarson Starkey, whose death prompted the Cal Poly ban, hadn't planned on joining a fraternity until he arrived at the public university of 19,000 on the central California coast. One out of six undergraduates there participate in Greek life.\nThe clean-cut, curly-haired 18-year-old from Austin, Texas, knew no one on campus, and the opportunity to bond with fraternity brothers soon appealed to him. He chose to pledge Sigma Alpha Epsilon, one of the largest fraternities, with chapters on almost 230 campuses in the U.S. and Canada.\n'Drink Up'\nWhile it included other activities such as a scavenger hunt, much of Sigma Alpha Epsilon's initiation revolved around alcohol. After Thanksgiving, fraternity members summoned Starkey and 16 other pledges to the garage of an off-campus house for \"Brown Bag Night.\" Tarps covered couches to protect them from vomit, according to court testimony. Pledges sat in a circle, with a trash can at the center.\nAt 10:30 p.m., each pledge was given a brown bag with cans and bottles of alcohol. \"Drink up, finish by midnight,\" said one upperclassman, according to court testimony.\nStarkey's bag had two 24-ounce cans of Steel Reserve beer, a 16-ounce can of Sparks alcoholic energy drink, and a fifth of rum he was to split with another pledge, one of several Sigma Alpha Epsilon brothers who bought the liquor testified. Pledges also shared a bottle of 151-proof Everclear, which is 75.5 percent alcohol. As members chanted \"Puke and Rally,\" Starkey emptied his bag in 20 minutes, court records show.\nDirty Mattress\nAfter Starkey passed out, fraternity brothers debated whether to drive him to a hospital less than a mile away, members testified. They placed Starkey in a car and removed his Sigma Alpha Epsilon pin, so that doctors wouldn't know he was at a fraternity event. Then they changed their minds. Rather than go to the hospital, they brought him back in the house and left him on a dirty mattress, according to court records and Starkey's mother, Julia.\nStarkey died on Dec. 2, 2008, 71 days after starting college. He had a blood-alcohol content of 0.44, or about five times the legal limit, according to court testimony.\nFour fraternity brothers pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges related to hazing. They were sentenced to jail terms ranging from 30 to 120 days.\nThe Starkeys sued Sigma Alpha Epsilon and several members for negligence, settling for at least $2.45 million, court records show.\nSigma Alpha Epsilon is committed to \"providing a meaningful, beneficial and safe experience\" for all members, the national fraternity said in a statement.\nCal Poly barred Sigma Alpha Epsilon from campus until 2033 and considered eliminating fraternities. Instead, it stepped up oversight and decided in 2010 to delay freshman recruiting until January, the school's second quarter.\n'Huge Pushback'\nSoon after the policy was announced, \"there was a huge pushback\" from the fraternity industry, said Stephan Lamb, then the university's associate director of student life.\nSmithhisler and other Interfraternity Conference executives visited the school in 2010 to ask administrators to rescind deferred recruitment.\n\"The hand-wringing has started\" among fraternity leaders about Cal Poly's limits on recruitment, Smithhisler wrote in a Jan. 12, 2011, e-mail to Lamb obtained through a request to the university under California's open-records law.\nThe next month, the trade group sent industry experts to Cal Poly to conduct an in-depth assessment of the school's Greek system, according to university records. Typically, universities request such an evaluation and pay an $8,000 fee. In this instance, the conference covered the cost.\nStealing, Drinking\nThe report was hardly flattering. The assessment, prepared by fraternity executives, college administrators and a social worker, called Cal Poly's recruitment \"dehumanizing and superficial\" and said alcohol was \"a, and perhaps THE, defining factor\" of Greek life.\n\"Hazing occurs in the men's chapters, particularly physical/strength endurance, stealing and drinking,\" it said. \"Alcohol plays a major role in the Cal Poly fraternity/sorority experience, especially within fraternity life.\"\nStill, the report called for an end to deferred recruitment because it runs \"counter to a student's right to choose.\" The policy unfairly required fraternities, but not sororities, to postpone rush, according to the assessment.\nThe national group worked through students, too. Andy Farrell, who headed Cal Poly's student fraternity group in 2010, said Smithhisler took him aside and \"made it clear that the [Interfraternity Conference] stand is that deferred recruitment should not exist.\"\nFighting Rules\nNational fraternities urged their Cal Poly chapters to fight the new rule, said Michael Franceschi, another student leader at the time. When students organized, the conference supplied them with research and helped edit a paper arguing against deferred recruitment.\n\"We'd send them drafts of each section,\" said Jason Colombini, then a campus fraternity leader and now student body president. \"They would tell us things to look into.\" Colombini said he acted on his own initiative, not the Interfraternity Conference's.\nTurnover at the top of Cal Poly aided the fraternity cause. Jeffrey Armstrong, who became Cal Poly's president in 2011, and Keith Humphrey, vice president for student affairs, sympathized with students' pleas, Colombini said. Unlike their predecessors, Armstrong and Humphrey had been in fraternities, and Armstrong met his wife through his membership in Alpha Gamma Rho.\nIn June, Cal Poly announced it would abolish deferred recruiting at its 17 fraternities. In return, fraternity members agreed to register their parties, undergo alcohol education and submit to periodic reviews. About $100,000 in higher fees from fraternity members will fund a new university position monitoring Greek life.\n'More Control'\nThe university didn't bow to fraternity pressure, Humphrey said. It simply wanted fraternity and sorority recruitment on the same schedule. Deferred recruiting isn't a \"silver bullet,\" Armstrong said.\n\"We're going to gain a lot more control\" through the agreement with fraternity members, Armstrong said. \"There will be a lot more accountability.\"\nThe Interfraternity Conference assured the university that fraternities had shown \"higher alcohol awareness.\" Humphrey agreed, saying that students are taking alcohol safety more seriously.\n\"We're entering a different day,\" he said.\nStill, the number of people transported to the hospital by Cal Poly police because of alcohol doubled to 35, in 2012-2013, from 2008, the year Starkey died. The statistics don't indicate how many belonged to fraternities. The increase shows that students are more willing to call for help, said Martin Bragg, Cal Poly's director of health and counseling services.\nLambda Cabana\nSince 2011, the university has disciplined nine fraternities, in most cases for alleged alcohol-related violations. After Lambda Chi Alpha's \"Lambda Cabana\" beach volleyball tournament and charity fundraiser in April, three underage partygoers went to the hospital with alcohol poisoning, according to university records.\nThe university suspended Lambda Chi activities. Lambda Chi Alpha said it hadn't organized any parties after the fundraiser, records show. Graham Garland, president of its Cal Poly chapter, declined to comment. The university later lifted the suspension because an investigation didn't support allegations against the fraternity, Humphrey said.\nIn an editorial this month, the student paper, the Mustang News, said fraternities haven't changed their behavior since Starkey's death, and the administration made a mistake in letting them recruit freshman right away.\n\"Cal Poly is opening the door for more trouble,\" the editorial said.\nParents Troubled\nCarson Starkey's parents, while pleased with the alcohol education program, opposed ending deferred recruitment. They run a nonprofit group to raise awareness about alcohol poisoning.\n\"I find it troubling that they [fraternities] would be advocating against our efforts to try to save lives,\" said Julia Starkey, 52.\nHer son would be alive if recruitment came later, she said.\n\"I'm 200 percent sure he wouldn't have joined,\" she said. \"His core group of friends were outside the fraternity, but that didn't happen the first weeks of school.\"\nFraternities are putting revenue ahead of safety, said his father, Scott Starkey, 54.\n\"If you defer the recruitment of your members, you're deferring income, I get that,\" he said. \"We're business people. But I also feel there's a human side.\"\nWelcoming Freshmen\nOn a crisp late summer day during freshman orientation last month at Cal Poly, posters near dormitory entrances urged students to wear black wristbands with the name of the Starkeys' charity: \"Aware Awake Alive.\"\n\"Take care of yourself,\" read the posters. \"Take care of your friends.\"\nFreshmen were divided over the new rush policy. Adam Massini, 18, from La Quinta, California, said it would be better to delay recruitment.\n\"Freshmen haven't had much experience with drinking and don't know their limits,\" said Massini, who is considering joining a fraternity to perform community service.\nWaiting isn't going to stop freshmen from drinking heavily, said Grant Caraway, a former star high school football quarterback from Granite Bay, California.\n\"Some guys are going to be stupid, no matter what,\" Caraway said.\nWith formal recruiting weeks away, a banner hung outside the Lambda Chi Alpha house. In bold, block letters, it greeted freshmen: \"Welcoming You the Right Way Since 1979.\"\nWhile deferred recruiting gave freshmen more time to choose a fraternity, Lambda Chi now has no choice but to pursue them right away, said Joe Hare, 21, its vice president.\n\"If all the fraternities do it, we can't wait,\" he said. \"It's social suicide.\"\nTo contact the reporters on this story: John Hechinger in Boston at jhechinger@bloomberg.net; David Glovin in New York at dglovin@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Dan Golden at dlgolden@bloomberg.net ", " One warm spring night in 2011, a young man named Travis Hughes stood on the back deck of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house at Marshall University, in West Virginia, and was struck by what seemed to him-under the influence of powerful inebriants, not least among them the clear ether of youth itself-to be an excellent idea: he would shove a bottle rocket up his ass and blast it into the sweet night air. And perhaps it was an excellent idea. What was not an excellent idea, however, was to misjudge the relative tightness of a 20-year-old sphincter and the propulsive reliability of a 20-cent bottle rocket. What followed ignition was not the bright report of a successful blastoff, but the muffled thud of fire in the hole.\nAlso on the deck, and also in the thrall of the night's pleasures, was one Louis Helmburg III, an education major and ace benchwarmer for the Thundering Herd baseball team. His response to the proposed launch was the obvious one: he reportedly whipped out his cellphone to record it on video, which would turn out to be yet another of the night's seemingly excellent but ultimately misguided ideas. When the bottle rocket exploded in Hughes's rectum, Helmburg was seized by the kind of battlefield panic that has claimed brave men from outfits far more illustrious than even the Thundering Herd. Terrified, he staggered away from the human bomb and fell off the deck. Fortunately for him, and adding to the Chaplinesque aspect of the night's miseries, the deck was no more than four feet off the ground, but such was the urgency of his escape that he managed to get himself wedged between the structure and an air-conditioning unit, sustaining injuries that would require medical attention, cut short his baseball season, and-in the fullness of time-pit him against the mighty forces of the Alpha Tau Omega national organization, which had been waiting for him.\nPhil Toledano\nIt takes a certain kind of personal-injury lawyer to look at the facts of this glittering night and wrest from them a plausible plaintiff and defendant, unless it were possible for Travis Hughes to be sued by his own anus. But the fraternity lawsuit is a lucrative mini-segment of the personal-injury business, and if ever there was a deck that ought to have had a railing, it was the one that served as a nighttime think tank and party-idea testing ground for the brain trust of the Theta Omicron Chapter of Alpha Tau Omega and its honored guests-including these two knuckleheads, who didn't even belong to the fraternity. Moreover, the building codes of Huntington, West Virginia, are unambiguous on the necessity of railings on elevated decks. Whether Helmburg stumbled in reaction to an exploding party guest or to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ is immaterial; there should have been a railing to catch him.\nAnd so it was that Louis Helmburg III joined forces with Timothy P. Rosinsky, Esq., a slip-and-fall lawyer from Huntington who had experience also with dog-bite, DUI, car-repossession, and drug cases. The events of that night, laid out in Helmburg's complaint, suggested a relatively straightforward lawsuit. But the suit would turn out to have its own repeated failures to launch and unintended collateral damage, and it would include an ever-widening and desperate search for potential defendants willing to foot the modest bill for Helmburg's documented injuries. Sending a lawyer without special expertise in wrangling with fraternities to sue one of them is like sending a Boy Scout to sort out the unpleasantness in Afghanistan. Who knows? The kid could get lucky. But it never hurts-preparedness and all that-to send him off with a body bag.\nrelated story 18 U.S. Presidents Were Frat Boys \"Fraternity men make up 85 percent of U.S. Supreme Court justices since 1910, 63 percent of all U.S. presidential cabinet members since 1900, and, historically, 76 percent of U.S. senators and 85 percent of Fortune 500 executives ... Fraternities really do breed leaders-a cohort of young men dedicated to being loyal, being knowledgeable, and embracing the skills of leadership success.\" Read the full story by Maria Konnikova\nCollege fraternities-by which term of art I refer to the formerly all-white, now nominally integrated men's \"general\" or \"social\" fraternities, and not the several other types of fraternities on American campuses (religious, ethnic, academic)-are as old, almost, as the republic. In a sense, they are older: they emanated in part from the Freemasons, of which George Washington himself was a member. When arguments are made in their favor, they are arguments in defense of a foundational experience for millions of American young men, and of a system that helped build American higher education as we know it. Fraternities also provide their members with matchless leadership training. While the system has produced its share of poets, aesthetes, and Henry James scholars, it is far more famous for its success in the powerhouse fraternity fields of business, law, and politics. An astonishing number of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, congressmen and male senators, and American presidents have belonged to fraternities. Many more thousands of American men count their fraternal experience-and the friendships made within it-as among the most valuable in their lives. The organizations raise millions of dollars for worthy causes, contribute millions of hours in community service, and seek to steer young men toward lives of service and honorable action. They also have a long, dark history of violence against their own members and visitors to their houses, which makes them in many respects at odds with the core mission of college itself.\nLawsuits against fraternities are becoming a growing matter of public interest, in part because they record such lurid events, some of them ludicrous, many more of them horrendous. For every butt bomb, there's a complaint of manslaughter, rape, sexual torture, psychological trauma. A recent series of articles on fraternities by Bloomberg News's David Glovin and John Hechinger notes that since 2005, more than 60 people-the majority of them students-have died in incidents linked to fraternities, a sobering number in itself, but one that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses. Many people believe that violent hazing is the most dangerous event associated with fraternity life, but hazing causes a relatively small percentage of these injuries. Because of a variety of forces, all this harm-and the behaviors that lead to it-has lately been moving out of the shadows of private disciplinary hearings and silent suffering, and into the bright light of civil lawsuits, giving us a clear picture of some of the more forbidding truths about fraternity life. While many of these suits never make it to trial, disappearing into confidential settlements (as did that of Louis Helmburg III, nearly two years after he filed his lawsuit) or melting away once plaintiffs recognize the powerful and monolithic forces they are up against, the narratives they leave behind in their complaints-all of them matters of public record-comprise a rich and potent testimony to the kinds of experiences regularly taking place on college campuses. Tellingly, the material facts of these complaints are rarely in dispute; what is contested, most often, is only liability.\nFar from being freakish and unpredictable events, fatal and near-fatal falls from fraternity-house roofs, balconies, windows, and sleeping porches are fairly regular occurrences across the country.\nI have spent most of the past year looking deeply into the questions posed by these lawsuits, and more generally into the particular nature of fraternity life on the modern American campus. Much of what I found challenged my beliefs about the system, assumptions that I came to see as grossly outdated, not because the nature of fraternity life has changed so much, but rather because life at the contemporary university has gone through such a profound transformation in the past quarter century. I found that the ways in which the system exerts its power-and maintains its longevity-in the face of the many potentially antagonistic priorities in contemporary higher education commanded my grudging respect. Fraternity tradition at its most essential is rooted in a set of old, deeply American, morally unassailable convictions, some of which-such as a young man's right to the freedom of association-emanate from the Constitution itself. In contrast, much of the policy governing college campuses today is rooted in the loose soil of a set of political and social fashions that change with the season, and that tend not to hold up to any kind of penetrating challenge. And this is why-to answer the vexing question \"why don't colleges just get rid of their bad fraternities?\"-the system, and its individual frats, have only grown in power and influence. Indeed, in many substantive ways, fraternities are now mightier than the colleges and universities that host them.\nThe entire multibillion-dollar, 2,000-campus American college system-with its armies of salaried professors, administrators, librarians, bursars, secretaries, admissions officers, alumni liaisons, development-office workers, coaches, groundskeepers, janitors, maintenance workers, psychologists, nurses, trainers, technology-support staffers, residence-life personnel, cafeteria workers, diversity-compliance officers, the whole shebang-depends overwhelmingly for its very existence on one resource: an ever-renewing supply of fee-paying undergraduates. It could never attract hundreds of thousands of them each year-many of them woefully unprepared for the experience, a staggering number (some 40 percent) destined never to get a degree, more than 60 percent of them saddled with student loans that they very well may carry with them to their deathbeds-if the experience were not accurately marketed as a blast. They show up on campus lugging enormous Bed Bath & Beyond bags crammed with \"essentials,\" and with new laptop computers, on which they will surf Facebook and Tumblr while some coot down at the lectern bangs on about Maslow's hierarchy and tries to make his PowerPoint slides appear right side up. Many of these consumer goods have been purchased with money from the very student loans that will haunt them for so long, but no matter: it's college; any cost can be justified. The kids arrive eager to hurl themselves upon the pasta bars and the climbing walls, to splash into the 12-person Jacuzzis and lounge around the outdoor fire pits, all of which have been constructed in a blatant effort to woo them away from competitors. They swipe prepaid cards in dormitory vending machines to acquire whatever tanning wipes or earbuds or condoms or lube or energy drinks the occasion seems to require. And every moment of the experience is sweetened by the general understanding that with each kegger and rager, each lazy afternoon spent snoozing on the quad (a forgotten highlighter slowly drying out on the open pages of Introduction to Economics, a Coke Zero sweating beside it), they are actively engaged in the most significant act of self-improvement available to an American young person: college!\nPhil Toledano\nThat all of this fun is somehow as essential as the education itself-is somehow part of a benevolent and ultimately edifying process of \"growing up\"-is one of the main reasons so many parents who are themselves in rocky financial shape will make economically ruinous decisions to support a four-year-residential-college experience for their children. There are many thousands of American undergraduates whose economic futures (and those of their parents) would be far brighter if they knocked off some of their general-education requirements online, or at the local community college-for pennies on the dollar-before entering the Weimar Republic of traditional-college pricing. But college education, like weddings and funerals, tends to prompt irrational financial decision making, and so here we are. Add another pesto flavor to the pasta bar, Dean Roland! We just lost another kid to online ed!\nThat pursuing a bachelor's degree might be something other than a deeply ascetic and generally miserable experience was once a preposterous idea. American colleges came into being with the express purpose of training young men for the ministry, a preparation that was marked by a chilly round of early risings, Greek and Latin recitations, religious study, and strict discipline meted out by a dour faculty-along with expectations of both temperance and chastity. Hardly conditions that would augur the current trillion-dollar student-loan balloon that hovers over us like a pre-ignition Hindenburg. But sexual frustration and homiletics would not last forever as the hallmarks of American college life.\nrelated story I Fought Back Against My College's Sexist Fraternity \"I was taken aback by the fact that these women would openly acknowledge what I thought we were too old to admit in college: These men were popular. And that made them powerful. And if we rocked the boat, we could be shunned.\" Read the full story by Meghan McCarthy\nIn 1825, at Union College, in upstate New York (hardly a garden of earthly delights in the best of circumstances, but surely a gulag experience for those stuck at Union; imagine studying Thessalonians in the ass-cracking cold of a Schenectady February), a small group of young men came up with a creative act of rebellion against the fun-busters who had them down: the formation of a secret club, which they grandly named the Kappa Alpha Society. Word of the group spread, and a new kind of college institution was founded, and with it a brand-new notion: that going to college could include some pleasure. It was the American age of societies, and this new type fit right in. As Nicholas Syrett observes in his excellent history of white men's college fraternities, The Company He Keeps, these early fraternities were in every way a measure of their time. They combined the secret handshakes and passwords of small boys' clubs; the symbols and rituals of Freemasonry; the new national interest in Greek, as opposed to Roman, culture as a model for an emerging citizenry; and the popularity of literary societies, elements of which-oratory, recitation, and the presentation of essays-the early fraternities included. Fraternities also gave young college men a way of behaving and of thinking about themselves that quickly took on surprisingly modern dimensions. An 1857 letter that a Sigma Phi member named Jenkins Holland sent to one of his fraternity brothers suggests the new system was already hitting full stride: \"I did get one of the nicest pieces of ass some day or two ago.\"\nFrom the very beginning, fraternities were loathed by the grown-ups running colleges, who tried to banish them. But independence from overbearing faculties-existing on a plane beyond the reach of discipline-was, in large measure, the point of fraternity membership; far from fearing the opprobrium of their knock-kneed overlords, the young men relished and even courted it. When colleges tried to shut them down, fraternities asserted that any threat to men's membership in the clubs constituted an infringement of their right to freedom of association. It was, at best, a legally delicate argument, but it was a symbolically potent one, and it has withstood through the years. The powerful and well-funded political-action committee that represents fraternities in Washington has fought successfully to ensure that freedom-of-association language is included in all higher-education reauthorization legislation, thus \"disallowing public Universities the ability to ban fraternities.\"\nAn 1857 letter that a Sigma Phi sent to one of his fraternity brothers suggests the new system was already hitting full stride: \"I did get one of the nicest pieces of ass some day or two ago.\"\nPerhaps the best testament to the deep power of fraternities is how quickly and widely they spread. Soon after Gold Rush money began flowing into the newly established state of California-giving rise to the improbable idea of building a great American university on the shores of the Pacific Ocean-fraternity men staked their own claim: a campus in Berkeley had existed barely a year before the brothers of Phi Delta Theta arrived to initiate new members. The thing to remember about fraternities is that when Kappa Alpha was founded at Union, in all of the United States there were only 4,600 college students; fraternities exist as deeply in the groundwater of American higher education as religious study-and have retained a far greater presence in the lives of modern students.\nIn fairly short order, a paradox began to emerge, one that exists to this day. While the fraternities continued to exert their independence from the colleges with which they were affiliated, these same colleges started to develop an increasingly bedeviling kind of interdependence with the accursed societies. To begin with, the fraternities involved themselves very deeply in the business of student housing, which provided tremendous financial savings to their host institutions, and allowed them to expand the number of students they could admit. Today, one in eight American students at four-year colleges lives in a Greek house, and a conservative estimate of the collective value of these houses across the country is $3 billion. Greek housing constitutes a troubling fact for college administrators (the majority of fraternity-related deaths occur in and around fraternity houses, over which the schools have limited and widely varying levels of operational oversight) and also a great boon to them (saving them untold millions of dollars in the construction and maintenance of campus-owned and -controlled dormitories).\nReader Responses Excerpts from comments posted to this story: \"My perspective as a fraternity member and former president of a 120 man chapter at a public university in the Midwest: Fraternity houses are inherently dangerous and fraternity houses are a hell of a lot of fun.\"\n-Valyrian Steel \"Like Peter Pan trying to corral the lost boys, the job of fraternity president and his team is incredibly difficult and one that illuminates the arguments for and against the fraternity system.\"\n-Joe \"Reform of the drinking laws would help the problems explored in this article a lot more than any realistic attack on the free association rights of young adults.\"\n-C.M. \"This is a good article about why lawyers are horrible and destroy everything enjoyable in society.\"\n-GregHood Read all comments\nMoreover, fraternities tie alumni to their colleges in a powerful and lucrative way. At least one study has affirmed what had long been assumed: that fraternity men tend to be generous to their alma maters. Furthermore, fraternities provide colleges with unlimited social programming of a kind that is highly attractive to legions of potential students, most of whom are not applying to ivy-covered rejection factories, but rather to vast public institutions and obscure private colleges that are desperate for students. When Mom is trying-against all better judgment-to persuade lackluster Joe Jr. to go to college, she gets a huge assist when she drives him over to State and he gets an eyeful of frat row. Joe Jr. may be slow to grasp even the most elemental concepts of math and English (his first two years of expensive college study will largely be spent in remediation of the subjects he should have learned, for free, in high school), but one look at the Fiji house and he gets the message: kids are getting laid here; kids are having fun. Maybe he ought to snuff out the joint and take a second look at that application Mom keeps pushing across the kitchen table.\nWill he be in increased physical jeopardy if he joins one of these clubs? The fraternity industry says no. When confronted with evidence of student injury and death in their houses, fraternities claim they are no worse than any other campus group; that they have become \"target defendants,\" prey to the avarice of tort lawyers excited by their many assets and extensive liability coverage. It is true that fraternity lawsuits tend to involve at least one, and often more, of the four horsemen of the student-life apocalypse, a set of factors that exist far beyond frat row and that are currently bringing college presidents to their knees. First and foremost of these is the binge-drinking epidemic, which anyone outside the problem has a hard time grasping as serious (everyone drinks in college!) and which anyone with knowledge of the current situation understands as a lurid and complicated disaster. The second is the issue of sexual assault of female undergraduates by their male peers, a subject of urgent importance but one that remains stubbornly difficult even to quantify, let alone rectify, although it absorbs huge amounts of student interest, outrage, institutional funding, and-increasingly-federal attention. The third is the growing pervasiveness of violent hazing on campus, an art form that reaches its apogee at fraternities, but that has lately spread to all sorts of student groups. And the fourth is the fact that Boomers, who in their own days destroyed the doctrine of in loco parentis so that they could party in blissful, unsupervised freedom, have grown up into the helicopter parents of today, holding fiercely to a pair of mutually exclusive desires: on the one hand that their kids get to experience the same unfettered personal freedoms of college that they remember so fondly, and on the other that the colleges work hard to protect the physical and emotional well-being of their precious children.\nBut it's impossible to examine particular types of campus calamity and not find that a large number of them cluster at fraternity houses. Surely they have cornered the market in injuries to the buttocks. The number of lawsuits that involve paddling gone wrong, or branding that necessitated skin grafts, or a particular variety of sexual torture reserved for hazing and best not described in the gentle pages of this magazine, is astounding. To say nothing of the University of Tennessee frat boy who got dropped off, insensate, at the university hospital's emergency room and was originally assumed to be the victim of a sexual assault, and only later turned out to have damaged his rectum by allegedly pumping wine into it through an enema hose, as had his pals.\nOr, to turn away from the buttocks, as surely a good number of fraternity men would be well advised to do, consider another type of fraternity injury: the tendency of brothers and their guests to get liquored up and fall off-or out of-the damn houses is a story in itself.\nThe campuses of Washington State University and the University of Idaho are located some eight miles apart in the vast agricultural region of the Northwest known as the Palouse. It was at the latter institution that the 19-year-old sophomore and newly minted Delta Delta Delta pledge Amanda Andaverde arrived in August of 2009, although she had scarcely moved into the Tri Delta house and registered for classes before she was at the center of events that would leave her with brain damage and cast her as the plaintiff in a major lawsuit filed on her behalf by her devastated parents.\nIt would have been an unremarkable Wednesday evening-focused on the kind of partying and hooking up that are frequent pleasures of modern sorority women-save for its hideous end. Andaverde and her sorority sisters began the night at Sigma Chi, where the \"sorority ladies\" drank alcohol and spent the evening with \"dates\" they had been assigned during a party game. (The language of Andaverde's legal complaint often seems couched in a combination of '50s lingo and polite euphemism, intended perhaps to preclude a conservative Idaho jury from making moralistic judgments about the plaintiff's behavior.) The charms of Andaverde's assigned date ran thin, apparently, because close to midnight, she left him and made her way over to the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house, where she quickly ended up on the third-floor sleeping porch.\nMany fraternity houses, especially older ones, have sleeping porches-sometimes called \"cold airs\" or \"rack rooms\"-typically located on the top floor of the buildings' gable ends. They are large rooms filled with bunks, some of which are stacked in triple tiers, and their large windows are often left open, even in the coldest months. Many fraternity members have exceedingly fond memories of their time on the porches, which they view-like so many fraternity traditions-as a simultaneously vexing and bonding experience. Although these group sleeping arrangements were once considered an impediment to a young man's sex life, the hookup culture, in which privacy is no longer a requirement of sexual activity, has changed that, and the sleeping-porch experience is once again coming into favor. For a variety of reasons, sleeping porches feature in a number of lawsuits, pointing to an astonishing fact: despite fraternity houses' position as de facto residence halls for so many American college students, safety features are decidedly spotty; about half of them don't even have fire sprinklers.\nThat pursuing a bachelor's degree might be something other than a deeply ascetic and generally miserable experience was once a preposterous idea.\nAccording to the complaint, shortly after arriving at SAE, Andaverde ran into a friend of hers, and he took her up to the sleeping porch, where he introduced her to a pal of his named Joseph Cody Cook. Andaverde and Cook talked, then climbed into Cook's bunk, where the two began kissing. It is at this point that the language of the suit finally frees itself of euphemism and reveals the fearsome power of the unambiguous, declarative sentence: \"Amanda rolled onto her shoulder toward the exterior wall, and suddenly, quickly, and unexpectedly dropped off Cook's mattress into the open exterior window, falling from the third-floor 'sleeping porch' to the cement approximately 25 feet below.\"\nThe injuries were devastating and included permanent brain injury. Andaverde was airlifted to a trauma center in Seattle, where she remained for many weeks; in the early days of her care, it seemed she might not survive. Eventually, however, she improved enough to leave the hospital and was transferred to a series of rehabilitation centers, where she spent many months learning to regain basic functions. Police, interviewed about the case, defended themselves the way police departments in college towns all over the country reasonably defend themselves when accused of not preventing a fraternity-house disaster: \"We just can't send undercover people into private houses or private parties,\" said David Duke, the Moscow, Idaho, assistant chief of police.\nLocal news outlets covered Andaverde's plight widely and sympathetically, although the optimism with which her \"miraculous\" recovery was celebrated was perhaps exaggerated. A television news report dedicated to that miracle revealed a young woman who, while she had escaped death, had clearly been grievously injured. As the reporter interviewed her mother, Andaverde sat in a wheelchair. When her hands were not propped on a black lap tray latched to the chair, she struggled to grasp a crayon and run it across the pages of a children's coloring book, or to place the six large pieces of a simple puzzle-square, triangle, circle-into their spaces. She eventually improved from this desperate state-learning to walk and dress herself-but she was a far cry from the student of veterinary medicine she had once been.\nThe local inclinations to see a badly injured college student as a figure deserving of community support, and to view even a limited recovery as evidence of the goodness of God, are not unaligned with regional preferences for self-reliance and for taking responsibility for one's own actions, however dire the consequences. The inevitable court case-in which the Andaverde family named not only SAE and Tri Delta as defendants, but also the University of Idaho and the Idaho State Board of Education-was dismissed on summary judgment because there was no dispute that Andaverde fell out of an open window, and because there was no evidence of an inherently dangerous condition in the house: that the window was open was obvious to anyone who walked into the room. The court determined that no other person or institution had a duty to protect Amanda from the actions and decisions-the decision to drink alcohol, as a minor; the decision to climb into a bunk bed; the impulse to roll over-that led to her accident.\nPhil Toledano\nAndaverde's case seemed to me to be an isolated tragedy, until I sent away to the Latah County courthouse for a copy of the complaint and discovered within it this sentence: \"Amanda's fall was the second fall of a student from an upper-story fraternity house window at the University of Idaho within approximately a two-week period.\" This struck me as an astonishing coincidence. I looked into the matter and found that, indeed, a 20-year-old man named Shane Meyer had fallen from the third-floor window of the Delta Tau Delta house just 12 days before Andaverde's fall from SAE; not surprisingly, the police reported that \"alcohol may have been a factor.\" He, too, had been airlifted to Seattle, and incredibly, the two fought for their lives in the same critical-care unit at Harborview Medical Center. I became intrigued by this kind of injury and began to do some more checking into the subject. I discovered that two months after Andaverde's fall, a 20-year-old student at Washington State-\"quite intoxicated,\" in the laconic assessment of a local cop-pitched forward and fell from a third-floor window of Alpha Kappa Lambda, escaping serious injury when his fall was broken by an SUV parked below. That these three events were not greeted on either campus by any kind of clamoring sense of urgency-that they were, rather, met with a resigned sort of \"here we go again\" attitude by campus administrators and with what appeared to be the pro forma appointment of an investigative task force-sparked my interest, and so it was that I entered the bizarre world of falls from fraternity houses, which, far from being freakish and unpredictable events, are in fact fairly regular occurrences across the country.\nDuring the 2012-13 school year on the Palouse-where students from the two campuses often share apartments and attend parties at each other's schools-the falls continued. In September, a student suffered serious injuries after falling off the roof of the Alpha Tau Omega house at the University of Idaho, and two days later a Washington State student fell three stories from a window at Phi Kappa Tau. In November, a 19-year-old suffered critical head injuries when he fell backwards off a second-floor balcony at the Washington State Lambda Chi Alpha house, necessitating the surgical removal of part of his skull. In April, a University of Idaho student named Krysta Huft filed a suit against the Delta Chi fraternity, seeking damages for a broken pelvis resulting from a 2011 fall, which she claims was from the house's third-story sleeping porch onto a basketball court beneath it.\nI decided to widen my search, and quickly discovered that this is not a phenomenon particular to the Northwest. Across the country, kids fall-disastrously-from the upper heights of fraternity houses with some regularity. They tumble from the open windows they are trying to urinate out of, slip off roofs, lose their grasp on drainpipes, misjudge the width of fire-escape landings. On February 25, 2012, a student at the University of California at Berkeley attempted to climb down the drainpipe of the Phi Gamma Delta house, fell, and suffered devastating injuries; on April 14 of the same year, a 21-year-old student at Gannon University, in Pennsylvania, died after a fall from the second-floor balcony of the Alpha Phi Delta house the night before; on May 13, a Cornell student was airlifted to a trauma center after falling from the fire escape at Delta Chi; on October 13, a student at James Madison University fell from the roof of the three-story Delta Chi house and was airlifted to the University of Virginia hospital; on December 1, a 19-year-old woman fell eight feet from the Sigma Alpha Mu house at Penn State.\nThis summer brought little relief. On July 13, a man fell more than 30 feet from a third-story window at the Theta Delta Chi house at the University of Washington and was transported to Harborview Medical Center (which must by now be developing a subspecialty in such injuries); that same day, a Dartmouth College employee, apparently having consumed LSD and marijuana, fell out of a second-story window of the Sigma Nu house and was seriously injured. On August 13, a student at the University of Oklahoma fell face-first off a balcony of the SAE house; the next day, a woman fell from a second-story fire escape at Phi Kappa Tau at Washington State University.\nThe current school year began, and still the falls continued. In September, a student at Washington State fell down a flight of stairs in the Delta Chi house and was rendered unconscious; a University of Minnesota student was hospitalized after falling off a second-floor balcony of the Phi Kappa Psi house; a Northwestern student was listed in critical condition after falling out of a third-floor window of the Phi Gamma Delta house; and an MIT student injured his head and genitals after falling through a skylight at the Phi Sigma Kappa house and landing some 40 feet below.\nThese falls, of course, are in addition to the many other kinds of havoc and tragedy associated with fraternities. On the Palouse, such incidents include the January 2013 death of 18-year-old Joseph Wiederrick, a University of Idaho freshman who had made the dean's list his first semester, and who had plans to become an architect. He had attended a party at SAE (of which he was not a member) and then wandered, apparently drunk and lost, for five miles before freezing to death under a bridge. They also include the March 2013 conviction of Jesse M. Vierstra, who, while visiting Sigma Chi over the University of Idaho's homecoming weekend, raped an 18-year-old freshman in the bushes outside the house. (He is appealing the decision.)\nThe notion that fraternities are target defendants did not hold true in my investigation. College students can (and do) fall out of just about any kind of residence, of course. But during the period of time under consideration, serious falls from fraternity houses on the two Palouse campuses far outnumbered those from other types of student residences, including privately owned apartments occupied by students. I began to view Amanda Andaverde's situation in a new light. Why are so many colleges allowing students to live and party in such unsafe locations? And why do the lawsuits against fraternities for this kind of serious injury and death-so predictable and so preventable-have such a hard time getting traction? The answers lie in the recent history of fraternities and the colleges and universities that host them.\nfrom the archives The Hazards of Duke \"With a social scene dominated by fraternities and sororities (a way of life consisting of ardent partying and hooking up, offset by spurts of busywork composing angry letters to campus newspapers and taking online alcohol-education classes), ... [Duke] is a university whose thoughtful students are overshadowed by its voraciously self-centered ones.\" Read the full story by Caitlin Flanagan in the Jan/Feb 2011 issue.\nWhat all of these lawsuits ultimately concern is a crucially important question in higher education, one that legal scholars have been grappling with for the past half century. This question is perhaps most elegantly expressed in the subtitle of Robert D. Bickel and Peter F. Lake's authoritative 1999 book on the subject, The Rights and Responsibilities of the Modern University: Who Assumes the Risks of College Life?\nThe answer to this question has been steadily evolving ever since the 1960s, when dramatic changes took place on American campuses, changes that affected both a university's ability to control student behavior and the status of fraternities in the undergraduate firmament. During this period of student unrest, the fraternities-long the unquestioned leaders in the area of sabotaging or ignoring the patriarchal control of school administrators-became the exact opposite: representatives of the very status quo the new activists sought to overthrow. Suddenly their beer bashes and sorority mixers, their panty raids and obsession with the big game, seemed impossibly reactionary when compared with the mind-altering drugs being sampled in off-campus apartments where sexual liberation was being born and the Little Red Book proved, if nothing else, a fantastic coaster for a leaky bong.\nAmerican students sought to wrest themselves entirely from the disciplinary control of their colleges and universities, institutions that had historically operated in loco parentis, carefully monitoring the private behavior of undergraduates. The students of the new era wanted nothing to do with that infantilizing way of existence, and fought to rid themselves of the various curfews, dorm mothers, demerit systems, and other modes of institutional oppression. If they were old enough to die in Vietnam, powerful enough to overthrow a president, groovy enough to expand their minds with LSD and free love, then they certainly didn't need their own colleges-the very places where they were forming their radical, nation-changing ideas-to treat them like teenyboppers in need of a sock hop and a chaperone. It was a turning point: American colleges began to regard their students not as dependents whose private lives they must shape and monitor, but as adult consumers whose contract was solely for an education, not an upbringing. The doctrine of in loco parentis was abolished at school after school. Through it all, fraternities-for so long the repositories of the most outrageous behavior-moldered, all but forgotten. Membership fell sharply, fraternity houses slid into increasing states of disrepair, and hundreds of chapters closed.\nAnimal House, released in 1978, at once predicted and to no small extent occasioned the roaring return of fraternity life that began in the early '80s and that gave birth to today's vital Greek scene. The casting of John Belushi was essential to the movie's influence: no one had greater credibility in the post-'60s youth culture. If something as fundamentally reactionary as fraternity membership was going to replace something as fundamentally radical as student unrest, it would need to align itself with someone whose bona fides among young, white, middle-class males were unassailable. In this newly forming culture, the drugs and personal liberation of the '60s would be paired with the self-serving materialism of the '80s, all of which made partying for its own sake-and not as a philosophical adjunct to solving some complicated problem in Southeast Asia-a righteous activity for the pampered young collegian. Fraternity life was reborn with a vengeance.\nIt was an entirely new kind of student who arrived at the doors of those great and crumbling mansions: at once deeply attracted to the ceremony and formality of fraternity life and yet utterly transformed by the social revolutions of the past decades. These new members and their countless guests brought with them hard drugs, new and ever-developing sexual attitudes, and a stunningly high tolerance for squalor (never had middle- and upper-middle-class American young people lived in such filth as did '60s and '70s college kids who were intent on rejecting their parents' bourgeois ways). Furthermore, in 1984 Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, with the ultimate result of raising the legal drinking age to 21 in all 50 states. This change moved college partying away from bars and college-sponsored events and toward private houses-an ideal situation for fraternities. When these advances were combined with the evergreen fraternity traditions of violent hazing and brawling among rival frats, the scene quickly became wildly dangerous.\nAdult supervision was nowhere to be found. Colleges had little authority to intervene in what took place in the personal lives of its students visiting private property. Fraternities, eager to provide their members with the independence that is at the heart of the system-and responsive to members' wish for the same level of freedom that non-Greek students enjoyed-had largely gotten rid of the live-in resident advisers who had once provided some sort of check on the brothers. With these conditions in place, lawsuits began to pour in.\nNo sooner has a national fraternity rolled out a new \"Men of Principle\" or \"True Gentlemen\" campaign than reports of a lurid disaster in some prominent or far-flung chapter undermine the whole thing.\nThe mid-1980s were a treacherous time to be the defendant in a tort lawsuit. Personal-injury cases had undergone a long shift to the plaintiff's advantage; the theory of comparative negligence-by which an individual can acknowledge his or her own partial responsibility for an injury yet still recover damages from a defendant-had become the standard; the era of huge jury verdicts was at hand. Americans in vast numbers-motivated perhaps in part by the possibility of financial recompense, and in part by a new national impetus to move personal suffering from the sphere of private sorrow to that of public confession and complaint-began to sue those who had damaged them. Many fraternity lawsuits listed the relevant college or university among the defendants, a practice still common among less experienced plaintiff's attorneys. These institutions possess deep reservoirs of liability coverage, but students rarely recover significant funds from their schools. As Amanda Andaverde's attorneys discovered the hard way, a great deal of time and money can be spent seeking damages from institutions of higher learning, which can be protected by everything from sovereign immunity and damage caps (in the case of public universities), to their limited ability to monitor the private behavior of their students. But for the fraternities themselves, it was a far different story.\nSo recently and robustly brought back to life, the fraternities now faced the most serious threat to their existence they had ever experienced. A single lawsuit had the potential to devastate a fraternity. In 1985, a young man grievously injured in a Kappa Alpha-related accident reached a settlement with the fraternity that, over the course of his lifetime, could amount to some $21 million-a sum that caught the attention of everyone in the Greek world. Liability insurance became both ruinously expensive and increasingly difficult to obtain. The insurance industry ranked American fraternities as the sixth-worst insurance risk in the country-just ahead of toxic-waste-removal companies. \"You guys are nuts,\" an insurance representative told a fraternity CEO in 1989, just before canceling the organization's coverage; \"you can't operate like this much longer.\"\nFor fraternities to survive, they needed to do four separate but related things: take the task of acquiring insurance out of the hands of the local chapters and place it in the hands of the vast national organizations; develop procedures and policies that would transfer as much of their liability as possible to outside parties; find new and creative means of protecting their massive assets from juries; and-perhaps most important of all-find a way of indemnifying the national and local organizations from the dangerous and illegal behavior of some of their undergraduate members. The way fraternities accomplished all of this is the underlying story in the lawsuits they face, and it is something that few members-and, I would wager, even fewer parents of members-grasp completely, comprising a set of realities you should absolutely understand in detail if your son ever decides to join a fraternity.\nSelf-insurance was an obvious means for combating prohibitive insurance pricing and the widening reluctance to insure fraternities. In 1992, four fraternities created what was first called the Fraternity Risk Management Trust, a vast sum of money used for reinsurance. Today, 32 fraternities belong to this trust. In 2006, a group of seven other fraternities bought their own insurance broker, James R. Favor, which now insures many others. More important than self-insurance, however, was the development of a risk-management policy that would become-across these huge national outfits and their hundreds of individual chapters-the industry standard. This was accomplished by the creation of something called the Fraternal Information and Programming Group (FIPG), which in the mid-1980s developed a comprehensive risk-management policy for fraternities that is regularly updated. Currently 32 fraternities are members of the FIPG and adhere to this policy, or to their own even more rigorous versions. One fraternity expert told me that even non-FIPG frats have similar policies, many based in large measure on FIPG's, which is seen as something of a blueprint. In a certain sense, you may think you belong to Tau Kappa Epsilon or Sigma Nu or Delta Tau Delta-but if you find yourself a part of life-changing litigation involving one of those outfits, what you really belong to is FIPG, because its risk-management policy (and your adherence to or violation of it) will determine your fate far more than the vows you made during your initiation ritual-vows composed by long-dead men who had never even heard of the concept of fraternity insurance.\nFIPG regularly produces a risk-management manual-the current version is 50 pages-that lays out a wide range of (optional) best practices. If the manual were Anna Karenina, alcohol policy would be its farming reform: the buzz-killing subplot that quickly reveals itself to be an authorial obsession. For good reason: the majority of all fraternity insurance claims involve booze-I have read hundreds of fraternity incident reports, not one of which describes an event where massive amounts of alcohol weren't part of the problem-and the need to manage or transfer risk presented by alcohol is perhaps the most important factor in protecting the system's longevity. Any plaintiff's attorney worth his salt knows how to use relevant social-host and dramshop laws against a fraternity; to avoid this kind of liability, the fraternity needs to establish that the young men being charged were not acting within the scope of their status as fraternity members. Once they violated their frat's alcohol policy, they parted company with the frat. It's a neat piece of logic: the very fact that a young man finds himself in need of insurance coverage is often grounds for denying it to him.\nSo: alcohol and the fraternity man. Despite everything you may think you know about life on frat row, there are actually only two FIPG-approved means of serving drinks at a frat party. The first is to hire a third-party vendor who will sell drinks and to whom some liability-most significant, that of checking whether drinkers are of legal age-will be transferred. The second and far more common is to have a BYO event, in which the liability for each bottle of alcohol resides solely in the person who brought it. If you think this is in any way a casual system, then you have never read either the FIPG risk-management manual or its sister publication, an essay written in the surrealist vein titled \"Making Bring Your Own Beverage Events Happen.\"\nThe official byo system is like something dreamed up by a committee of Soviet bureaucrats and Irish nuns. It begins with the composition-no fewer than 24 hours before the party-of a comprehensive guest list. This guest list does not serve the happy function of ensuring a perfect mix of types and temperaments at the festivity; rather, it limits attendance-and ensures that the frat is in possession of \"a witness list in the event something does occur which may end up in court two or more years later.\" Provided a fraternity member-let's call him Larry-is older than 21 (which the great majority of members, like the great majority of all college students, are not), he is allowed to bring six (and no more) beers or four (and no more) wine coolers to the party. (FIPG's admiration for the wine-cooler four-pack suggests that at least some aspects of the foundational document-including its recommendation for throwing a M*A*S*H-themed party as recently as 2007-have not received much of an overhaul since its first edition, published in the mid-'80s.) Okay, so Larry brings a six-pack. The first stop, depending on which fraternity he belongs to: a \"sober check point,\" at which he is subjected to an examination. Does he appear to have already consumed any alcohol? Is he in any way \"known\" to have done so? If he passes, he hands over his ID for inspection. Next he must do business with a \"sober monitor.\" This person relieves him of the six-pack, hands him a ticket indicating the precise type of beer he brought, and ideally affixes a \"non breakable except by cutting\" wristband to his person; only then can Larry retrieve his beers, one at a time, for his own personal consumption. If any are left over at the end of the party, his fraternity will secure them until the next day, when Larry can be reunited with his unconsumed beers, unless his frat decided to \"eliminate\" them overnight. Weaknesses in the system include the fact that all of these people coming between Larry and his beer-the sober monitors and ID checkers and militarized barkeeps-are Larry's fraternity brothers, who are among his closest buddies and who have pledged him lifelong fealty during candlelit ceremonies rife with Masonic mumbo jumbo and the fluttering language of 19th-century romantic friendship. Note also that these policies make it possible for fraternities to be the one industry in the country in which every aspect of serving alcohol can be monitored and managed by people who are legally too young to drink it.\nDuring a crisis, the questionnaires and honest accounts that fraternity members submit gratefully to their national organization may return to haunt many of the brothers.\nClearly, a great number of fraternity members will, at some point in their undergraduate career, violate their frat's alcohol policy regarding the six beers-and just as clearly, the great majority will never face any legal consequences for doing so. But when the inevitable catastrophes do happen, that policy can come to seem more like a cynical hoax than a real-world solution to a serious problem. When something terrible takes place-a young man plummets from a roof, a young woman is assaulted, a fraternity brother is subjected to the kind of sexual sadism that appears all too often in fraternity lawsuits-any small violation of policy can leave fraternity members twisting in the wind. Consider the following scenario: Larry makes a small, human-size mistake one night. Instead of waiting for the slow drip of six warm beers, he brings a bottle of Maker's Mark to the party, and-in the spirit of not being a weirdo or a dick-he shares it, at one point pouring a couple of ounces into the passing Solo cup of a kid who's running on empty and asks him for a shot. Larry never sees the kid again that night-not many people do; he ends up drinking himself to death in an upstairs bedroom. In the sad fullness of time, the night's horror is turned into a lawsuit, in which Larry becomes a named defendant. Thanks in part to the guest/witness list, Larry can be cut loose, both from the expensive insurance he was required to help pay for (by dint of his dues) as a precondition of membership, and from any legal defense paid for by the organization. What will happen to Larry now?\nGentle reader, if you happen to have a son currently in a college fraternity, I would ask that you take several carbon dioxide-rich deep breaths from a paper bag before reading the next paragraph. I'll assume you are sitting down. Ready?\n\"I've recovered millions and millions of dollars from homeowners' policies,\" a top fraternal plaintiff's attorney told me. For that is how many of the claims against boys who violate the strict policies are paid: from their parents' homeowners' insurance. As for the exorbitant cost of providing the young man with a legal defense for the civil case (in which, of course, there are no public defenders), that is money he and his parents are going to have to scramble to come up with, perhaps transforming the family home into an ATM to do it. The financial consequences of fraternity membership can be devastating, and they devolve not on the 18-year-old \"man\" but on his planning-for-retirement parents.\nLike the six-beer policy, the Fraternal Information and Programming Group's chillingly comprehensive crisis-management plan was included in its manual for many years. But in 2013, the plan suddenly disappeared from its pages. When asked why this was so, Dave Westol, a longtime FIPG board member, said, \"Member organizations prefer to establish their own procedures, and therefore the section has been eliminated.\" However, many fraternities continue to rely on the group's advice for in-house risk management, and it is well worth examining if you want to know what takes place in the hours following many fraternity disasters. As it is described in the two most recent editions that I was able to obtain (2003 and 2007), the plan serves a dual purpose, at once benevolent and mercenary. The benevolent part is accomplished by the clear directive that injured parties are to receive immediate medical attention, and that all fraternity brothers who come into contact with the relevant emergency workers are to be completely forthright about what has taken place. And the rest? The plans I obtained recommend six important steps:\n1. In the midst of the horror, the chapter president takes immediate, commanding, and inspiring control of the situation: \"In times of stress, leaders step forward.\"\n2. A call is made to the fraternity's crisis hotline or the national headquarters, no matter the hour: \"Someone will be available. They would much rather hear about a situation from you at 3:27 a.m. than receive an 8:01 a.m. telephone call from a reporter asking for a comment about 'The situation involving your chapter at ____.' \"\n3. The president closes the fraternity house to outsiders and summons all members back to the house: \"Unorthodox situations call for unorthodox responses from leaders. Most situations occur at night. Therefore, be prepared to call a meeting of all members and all pledged members as soon as possible, even if that is at 3 a.m.\"\n4. One member-who has already received extensive media training-is put in charge of all relations with the press, an entity fraternities view as biased and often unscrupulous. The appointed member should be prepared to present a concise, factual, and minimally alarming account of what took place. For example: \"A new member was injured at a social event.\"\n5. In the case of the death of a guest or a member, fraternity brothers do not attempt direct contact with the deceased's parents. This hideous task is to be left to the impersonal forces of the relevant professionals. (I know of one family who did not know their son was in any kind of trouble until-many hours after his death, and probably long after his fraternity brothers had initiated the crisis-management protocol-their home phone rang and the caller ID came up with the area code of their boy's college and a single word: coroner). If the dead person was a fraternity member who lived in the house, his brothers should return any borrowed items to his room and temporarily relocate his roommate, if he had one. Members may offer to pack up his belongings, but \"it is more likely the family will want to do this themselves.\" Several empty boxes might thoughtfully be left outside the room for this purpose.\n6. Members sit tight until consultants from the national organization show up to take control of the situation and to walk them through the next steps, which often include the completion of questionnaires explaining exactly what happened and one-on-one interviews with the fraternity representatives. The anxious brothers are reminded to be completely honest and forthcoming in these accounts, and to tell the folks from national absolutely everything they know so that the situation can be resolved in the best possible manner.\nAs you should by now be able to see very clearly, the interests of the national organization and the individual members cleave sharply as this crisis-management plan is followed. Those questionnaires and honest accounts-submitted gratefully to the grown-ups who have arrived, the brothers believe, to help them-may return to haunt many of the brothers, providing possible cause for separating them from the fraternity, dropping them from the fraternity's insurance, laying the blame on them as individuals and not on the fraternity as the sponsoring organization. Indeed, the young men who typically rush so gratefully into the open arms of the representatives from their beloved national-an outfit to which they have pledged eternal allegiance-would be far better served by not talking to them at all, by walking away from the chapter house as quickly as possible and calling a lawyer.\nThe financial consequences of fraternity membership can be devastating, and they devolve not on the 18-year-old \"man\" but on his planning-for-retirement parents.\nSo here is the essential question: In the matter of these disasters, are fraternities acting in an ethical manner, requiring good behavior from their members and punishing them soundly for bad or even horrific decisions? Or are they keeping a cool distance from the mayhem, knowing full well that misbehavior occurs with regularity (\"most events take place at night\") and doing nothing about it until the inevitable tragedy occurs, at which point they cajole members into incriminating themselves via a crisis-management plan presented as being in their favor?\nThe opposing positions on this matter are held most forcefully and expressed most articulately by two men: Douglas Fierberg, the best plaintiff's attorney in the country when it comes to fraternity-related litigation, and Peter Smithhisler, the CEO of the North-American Interfraternity Conference, a trade organization representing 75 fraternities, among them all 32 members of the Fraternal Information and Programming Group. In a parallel universe, the two men would be not adversaries but powerful allies, for they have much in common: both are robust midwesterners in the flush of vital middle age and at the zenith of their professional powers; both possess more dark knowledge of college-student life and collegiate binge drinking than many, if not most, of the experts hired to study and quantify the phenomenon; both have built careers devoted to the lives and betterment of young people. But two roads diverged in the yellow wood, and here we are. One man is an avenger, a gun for hire, a person constitutionally ill-prepared to lose a fight; the other is a conciliator, a patient explainer, a man ever willing to lift the flap of his giant tent and welcome you inside. I have had long and wide-ranging conversations with both men, in which each put forth his perspective on the situation.\nFierberg is a man of obvious and deep intelligence, comfortable-in the way of alpha-male litigators-with sharply correcting a fuzzy thought; with using obscenities; with speaking derisively, even contemptuously, of opponents. He is also the man I would run to as though my hair were on fire if I ever found myself in a legal battle with a fraternity, and so should you. In a year of reporting this story, I have not spoken with anyone outside of the fraternity system who possesses a deeper understanding of its inner workings; its closely guarded procedures and money trails; and the legal theories it has developed over the past three decades to protect itself, often very successfully, from lawsuits. Fierberg speaks frequently and openly with the press, and because of this-and because of the reticence of senior members of the fraternity system to speak at length with meddlesome journalists-the media often reflect his attitude.\nFor all these reasons, Fierberg is generally loathed by people at the top of the fraternity world, who see him as a money-hungry lawyer who has chosen to chase their particular ambulance, and whose professed zeal for reforming the industry is a sham: what he wants is his share of huge damages, not systemic changes that would cut off the money flow. But in my experience of him, this is simply not the case. Sure, he has built a lucrative practice. But he is clearly passionate about his cause and the plight of the kids-some of them horribly injured, others dead-who comprise his caseload, along with their shattered parents.\n\"Until proven otherwise,\" Fierberg told me in April of fraternities, \"they all are very risky organizations for young people to be involved in.\" He maintains that fraternities \"are part of an industry that has tremendous risk and a tremendous history of rape, serious injury, and death, and the vast majority share common risk-management policies that are fundamentally flawed. Most of them are awash in alcohol. And most if not all of them are bereft of any meaningful adult supervision.\" As for the risk-management policies themselves: \"They are primarily designed to take the nationals' fingerprints off the injury and deaths, and I don't believe that they offer any meaningful provisions.\" The fraternity system, he argues, is \"the largest industry in this country directly involved in the provision of alcohol to underage people.\" The crisis-management plans reveal that in \"the foreseeable future\" there may be \"the death or serious injury\" of a healthy young person at a fraternity function.\nAre fraternities acting in an ethical manner, requiring good behavior and punishing poor decisions? Or are they keeping a cool distance from the mayhem, knowing full well that it occurs with regularity?\nAnd then there is Peter Smithhisler, who is the senior fraternity man ne plus ultra: unfailingly, sometimes elaborately courteous; careful in his choice of words; unflappable; and as unlikely to interrupt or drop the f-bomb on a respectful female journalist as he would be to join the Communist Party. He is the kind of man you would want on your side in a tough spot, the kind of man you would want mentoring your son through the challenging passage from late adolescence to young manhood. He believes that the fraternity experience at its best constitutes an appeal to a young man's better angels: through service, leadership training, and accountability for mistakes, a brother can learn the valuable lessons he will need to become \"a better dad, a better teacher, a better engineer, a better pilot, a better 'insert career here.'\" Spend some time talking with Pete Smithhisler, and you can go from refusing to allow your son to join a fraternity to demanding he do so. Indeed, the day after I talked with him, I happened to be at a social gathering where I met two women whose sons had just graduated from college. \"The fraternity was what saved him,\" one mother said with great feeling. Her son had waited until sophomore year to rush, and freshman year he had been so lonely and unsure of himself that she had become deeply worried about him. But everything changed after he pledged. He had friends; he was happy. When he'd had to have some surgery while at school, his brothers had visited him almost around the clock, bringing him food, keeping up his spirits, checking in with his doctors and charming his nurses. \"If only I could have gotten my son to join one,\" the other mom said, wistfully. \"I kept trying, but he wouldn't do it.\" Why had she wished he'd pledged a fraternity? \"He would have been so much more connected to the college,\" she said. \"He would have had so many other opportunities.\""], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "5689, 5971", "docSpanText": "Lawsuits against fraternities are becoming a growing matter of public interest, in part because they record such lurid events, some of them ludicrous, many more of them horrendous.

To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow-so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives-like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training.

This publication offers practical guidance on Made in USA claims.\nIntroduction\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is charged with preventing deception and unfairness in the marketplace. The FTC Act gives the Commission the power to bring law enforcement actions against false or misleading claims that a product is of U.S. origin. Traditionally, the Commission has required that a product advertised as Made in USA be \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S. After a comprehensive review of Made in USA and other U.S. origin claims in product advertising and labeling, the Commission announced in December 1997 that it would retain the \"all or virtually all\" standard. The Commission also issued an Enforcement Policy Statement on U.S. Origin Claims to provide guidance to marketers who want to make an unqualified Made in USA claim under the \"all or virtually all\" standard and those who want to make a qualified Made in USA claim.\nThis publication provides additional guidance about how to comply with the \"all or virtually all\" standard. It also offers some general information about the U.S. Customs Service's requirement that all products of foreign origin imported into the U.S. be marked with the name of the country of origin.\nThis publication is the Federal Trade Commission staff's view of the law's requirements. It is not binding on the Commission. The Enforcement Policy Statement issued by the FTC is at the end of the publication.\nBasic Information About Made In USA Claims\nMust U.S. content be disclosed on products sold in the U.S.?\nU.S. content must be disclosed on automobiles and textile, wool, and fur products. There's no law that requires most other products sold in the U.S. to be marked or labeled Made in USA or have any other disclosure about their amount of U.S. content. However, manufacturers and marketers who choose to make claims about the amount of U.S. content in their products must comply with the FTC's Made in USA policy.\nWhat products does the FTC's Made in USA policy apply to?\nThe policy applies to all products advertised or sold in the U.S., except for those specifically subject to country-of-origin labeling by other laws. Other countries may have their own country-of-origin marking requirements. As a result, exporters should determine whether the country to which they are exporting imposes such requirements.\nWhat kinds of claims does the Enforcement Policy Statement apply to?\nThe Enforcement Policy Statement applies to U.S. origin claims that appear on products and labeling, advertising, and other promotional materials. It also applies to all other forms of marketing, including marketing through digital or electronic mechanisms, such as Internet or e-mail.\nA Made in USA claim can be express or implied.\nExamples of express claims: Made in USA. \"Our products are American-made.\" \"USA.\"\nIn identifying implied claims, the Commission focuses on the overall impression of the advertising, label, or promotional material. Depending on the context, U.S. symbols or geographic references (for example, U.S. flags, outlines of U.S. maps, or references to U.S. locations of headquarters or factories) may convey a claim of U.S. origin either by themselves, or in conjunction with other phrases or images.\nExample: A company promotes its product in an ad that features a manager describing the \"true American quality\" of the work produced at the company's American factory. Although there is no express representation that the company's product is made in the U.S., the overall - or net - impression the ad is likely to convey to consumers is that the product is of U.S. origin.\nBrand names and trademarks\nOrdinarily, the Commission will not consider a manufacturer or marketer's use of an American brand name or trademark by itself as a U.S. origin claim. Similarly, the Commission is not likely to interpret the mere listing of a company's U.S. address on a package label in a non-prominent way as a claim of U.S. origin.\nExample: A product is manufactured abroad by a well-known U.S. company. The fact that the company is headquartered in the U.S. also is widely known. Company pamphlets for its foreign-made product prominently feature its brand name. Assuming that the brand name does not specifically denote U.S. origin (that is, the brand name is not \"Made in America, Inc.\"), using the brand name by itself does not constitute a claim of U.S. origin.\nRepresentations about entire product lines\nManufacturers and marketers should not indicate, either expressly or implicitly, that a whole product line is of U.S. origin (\"Our products are made in USA\") when only some products in the product line are made in the U.S. according to the \"all or virtually all\" standard.\nDoes the FTC pre-approve Made in USA claims?\nThe Commission does not pre-approve advertising or labeling claims. A company doesn't need approval from the Commission before making a Made in USA claim. As with most other advertising claims, a manufacturer or marketer may make any claim as long as it is truthful and substantiated.\nThe Standard For Unqualified Made In USA Claims\nWhat is the standard for a product to be called Made in USA without qualification?\nFor a product to be called Made in USA, or claimed to be of domestic origin without qualifications or limits on the claim, the product must be \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S. The term \"United States,\" as referred to in the Enforcement Policy Statement, includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories and possessions.\nWhat does \"all or virtually all\" mean?\n\"All or virtually all\" means that all significant parts and processing that go into the product must be of U.S. origin. That is, the product should contain no - or negligible - foreign content.\nWhat substantiation is required for a Made in USA claim?\nWhen a manufacturer or marketer makes an unqualified claim that a product is Made in USA, it should have - and rely on - a \"reasonable basis\" to support the claim at the time it is made. This means a manufacturer or marketer needs competent and reliable evidence to back up the claim that its product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.\nWhat factors does the Commission consider to determine whether a product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.?\nThe product's final assembly or processing must take place in the U.S. The Commission then considers other factors, including how much of the product's total manufacturing costs can be assigned to U.S. parts and processing, and how far removed any foreign content is from the finished product. In some instances, only a small portion of the total manufacturing costs are attributable to foreign processing, but that processing represents a significant amount of the product's overall processing. The same could be true for some foreign parts. In these cases, the foreign content (processing or parts) is more than negligible, and, as a result, unqualified claims are inappropriate.\nExample: A company produces propane barbecue grills at a plant in Nevada. The product's major components include the gas valve, burner and aluminum housing, each of which is made in the U.S. The grill's knobs and tubing are imported from Mexico. An unqualified Made in USA claim is not likely to be deceptive because the knobs and tubing make up a negligible portion of the product's total manufacturing costs and are insignificant parts of the final product. Example: A table lamp is assembled in the U.S. from American-made brass, an American-made Tiffany-style lampshade, and an imported base. The base accounts for a small percent of the total cost of making the lamp. An unqualified Made in USA claim is deceptive for two reasons: The base is not far enough removed in the manufacturing process from the finished product to be of little consequence and it is a significant part of the final product.\nWhat items should manufacturers and marketers include in analyzing the percentage of domestic content in a particular product?\nManufacturers and marketers should use the cost of goods sold or inventory costs of finished goods in their analysis. Such costs generally are limited to the total cost of all manufacturing materials, direct manufacturing labor, and manufacturing overhead.\nShould manufacturers and marketers rely on information from American suppliers about the amount of domestic content in the parts, components, and other elements they buy and use for their final products?\nIf given in good faith, manufacturers and marketers can rely on information from suppliers about the domestic content in the parts, components, and other elements they produce. Rather than assume that the input is 100 percent U.S.-made, however, manufacturers and marketers would be wise to ask the supplier for specific information about the percentage of U.S. content before they make a U.S. origin claim.\nExample: A company manufactures food processors in its U.S. plant, making most of the parts, including the housing and blade, from U.S. materials. The motor, which constitutes 50 percent of the food processor's total manufacturing costs, is bought from a U.S. supplier. The food processor manufacturer knows that the motor is assembled in a U.S. factory. Even though most of the parts of the food processor are of U.S. origin, the final assembly is in the U.S., and the motor is assembled in the U.S., the food processor is not considered \"all or virtually all\" American-made if the motor itself is made of imported parts that constitute a significant percentage of the appliance's total manufacturing cost. Before claiming the product is Made in USA, this manufacturer should look to its motor supplier for more specific information about the motor's origin. Example: On its purchase order, a company states: \"Our company requires that suppliers certify the percentage of U.S. content in products supplied to us. If you are unable or unwilling to make such certification, we will not purchase from you.\" Appearing under this statement is the sentence, \"We certify that our ___ have at least ___% U.S. content,\" with space for the supplier to fill in the name of the product and its percentage of U.S. content. The company generally could rely on a certification like this to determine the appropriate country-of-origin designation for its product.\nHow far back in the manufacturing process should manufacturers and marketers look?\nTo determine the percentage of U.S. content, manufacturers and marketers should look back far enough in the manufacturing process to be reasonably sure that any significant foreign content has been included in their assessment of foreign costs. Foreign content incorporated early in the manufacturing process often will be less significant to consumers than content that is a direct part of the finished product or the parts or components produced by the immediate supplier.\nExample: The steel used to make a single component of a complex product (for example, the steel used in the case of a computer's floppy drive) is an early input into the computer's manufacture, and is likely to constitute a very small portion of the final product's total cost. On the other hand, the steel in a product like a pipe or a wrench is a direct and significant input. Whether the steel in a pipe or wrench is imported would be a significant factor in evaluating whether the finished product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.\nAre raw materials included in the evaluation of whether a product is \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.?\nIt depends on how much of the product's cost the raw materials make up and how far removed from the finished product they are.\nExample: If the gold in a gold ring is imported, an unqualified Made in USA claim for the ring is deceptive. That's because of the significant value the gold is likely to represent relative to the finished product, and because the gold - an integral component - is only one step back from the finished article. By contrast, consider the plastic in the plastic case of a clock radio otherwise made in the U.S. of U.S.-made components. If the plastic case was made from imported petroleum, a Made in USA claim is likely to be appropriate because the petroleum is far enough removed from the finished product, and is an insignificant part of it as well.\nQualified Claims\nWhat is a qualified Made in USA claim?\nA qualified Made in USA claim describes the extent, amount or type of a product's domestic content or processing; it indicates that the product isn't entirely of domestic origin.\nExample: \"60% U.S. content.\" \"Made in USA of U.S. and imported parts.\" \"Couch assembled in USA from Italian Leather and Mexican Frame.\"\nWhen is a qualified Made in USA claim appropriate?\nA qualified Made in USA claim is appropriate for products that include U.S. content or processing but don't meet the criteria for making an unqualified Made in USA claim. Because even qualified claims may imply more domestic content than exists, manufacturers or marketers must exercise care when making these claims. That is, avoid qualified claims unless the product has a significant amount of U.S. content or U.S. processing. A qualified Made in USA claim, like an unqualified claim, must be truthful and substantiated.\nExample: An exercise treadmill is assembled in the U.S. The assembly represents significant work and constitutes a \"substantial transformation\" (a term used by the U.S. Customs Service). All of the treadmill's major parts, including the motor, frame, and electronic display, are imported. A few of its incidental parts, such as the handle bar covers, the plastic on/off power key, and the treadmill mat, are manufactured in the U.S. Together, these parts account for approximately three percent of the total cost of all the parts. Because the value of the U.S.-made parts is negligible compared to the value of all the parts, a claim on the treadmill that it is \"Made in USA of U.S. and Imported Parts\" is deceptive. A claim like \"Made in U.S. from Imported Parts\" or \"Assembled in U.S.A.\" would not be deceptive.\nU.S. origin claims for specific processes or parts\nClaims that a particular manufacturing or other process was performed in the U.S. or that a particular part was manufactured in the U.S. must be truthful, substantiated, and clearly refer to the specific process or part, not to the general manufacture of the product, to avoid implying more U.S. content than exists.\nManufacturers and marketers should be cautious about using general terms, such as \"produced,\" \"created\" or \"manufactured\" in the U.S. Words like these are unlikely to convey a message limited to a particular process. Additional qualification probably is necessary to describe a product that is not \"all or virtually all\" made in the U.S.\nIn addition, if a product is of foreign origin (that is, it has been substantially transformed abroad), manufacturers and marketers also should make sure they satisfy Customs' markings statute and regulations that require such products to be marked with a foreign country of origin. Further, Customs requires the foreign country of origin to be preceded by \"Made in,\" \"Product of,\" or words of similar meaning when any city or location that is not the country of origin appears on the product.\nExample: A company designs a product in New York City and sends the blueprint to a factory in Finland for manufacturing. It labels the product \"Designed in USA - Made in Finland.\" Such a specific processing claim would not lead a reasonable consumer to believe that the whole product was made in the U.S. The Customs Service requires the product to be marked \"Made in,\" or \"Product of\" Finland since the product is of Finnish origin and the claim refers to the U.S. Examples of other specific processing claims are: \"Bound in U.S. - Printed in Turkey.\" \"Hand carved in U.S. - Wood from Philippines.\" \"Software written in U.S. - Disk made in India.\" \"Painted and fired in USA. Blanks made in (foreign country of origin).\" Example: A company advertises its product, which was invented in Seattle and manufactured in Bangladesh, as \"Created in USA.\" This claim is deceptive because consumers are likely to interpret the term \"Created\" as Made in USA - an unqualified U.S. origin claim. Example: A computer imported from Korea is packaged in the U.S. in an American-made corrugated paperboard box containing only domestic materials and domestically produced expanded rigid polystyrene plastic packing. Stating Made in USA on the package would deceive consumers about the origin of the product inside. But the company could legitimately make a qualified claim, such as \"Computer Made in Korea - Packaging Made in USA.\" Example: The Acme Camera Company assembles its cameras in the U.S. The camera lenses are manufactured in the U.S., but most of the remaining parts are imported. A magazine ad for the camera is headlined \"Beware of Imported Imitations\" and states \"Other high-end camera makers use imported parts made with cheap foreign labor. But at Acme Camera, we want only the highest quality parts for our cameras and we believe in employing American workers. That's why we make all of our lenses right here in the U.S.\" This ad is likely to convey that more than a specific product part (the lens) is of U.S. origin. The marketer should be prepared to substantiate the broader U.S. origin claim conveyed to consumers viewing the ad.\nComparative Claims\nComparative claims should be truthful and substantiated, and presented in a way that makes the basis for comparison clear (for example, whether the comparison is to another leading brand or to a previous version of the same product). They should truthfully describe the U.S. content of the product and be based on a meaningful difference in U.S. content between the compared products.\nExample: An ad for cellular phones states \"We use more U.S. content than any other cellular phone manufacturer.\" The manufacturer assembles the phones in the U.S. from American and imported components and can substantiate that the difference between the U.S. content of its phones and that of the other manufacturers' phones is significant. This comparative claim is not deceptive. Example: A product is advertised as having \"twice as much U.S. content as before.\" The U.S. content in the product has been increased from 2 percent in the previous version to 4 percent in the current version. This comparative claim is deceptive because the difference between the U.S. content in the current and previous version of the product are insignificant.\nAssembled in USA Claims\nA product that includes foreign components may be called \"Assembled in USA\" without qualification when its principal assembly takes place in the U.S. and the assembly is substantial. For the \"assembly\" claim to be valid, the product's last \"substantial transformation\" also should have occurred in the U.S. That's why a \"screwdriver\" assembly in the U.S. of foreign components into a final product at the end of the manufacturing process doesn't usually qualify for the \"Assembled in USA\" claim.\nExample: A lawn mower, composed of all domestic parts except for the cable sheathing, flywheel, wheel rims and air filter (15 to 20 percent foreign content) is assembled in the U.S. An \"Assembled in USA\" claim is appropriate. Example: All the major components of a computer, including the motherboard and hard drive, are imported. The computer's components then are put together in a simple \"screwdriver\" operation in the U.S., are not substantially transformed under the Customs Standard, and must be marked with a foreign country of origin. An \"Assembled in U.S.\" claim without further qualification is deceptive.\nThe FTC and The Customs Service\nWhat is the U.S. Customs Service's jurisdiction over country-of-origin claims?\nThe Tariff Act gives Customs and the Secretary of the Treasury the power to administer the requirement that imported goods be marked with a foreign country of origin (for example, \"Made in Japan\").\nWhen an imported product incorporates materials and/or processing from more than one country, Customs considers the country of origin to be the last country in which a \"substantial transformation\" took place. Customs defines \"substantial transformation\" as a manufacturing process that results in a new and different product with a new name, character, and use that is different from that which existed before the change. Customs makes country-of-origin determinations using the \"substantial transformation\" test on a case-by-case basis. In some instances, Customs uses a \"tariff shift\" analysis, comparable to \"substantial transformation,\" to determine a product's country of origin.\nWhat is the interaction between the FTC and Customs regarding country-of-origin claims?\nEven if Customs determines that an imported product does not need a foreign country-of-origin mark, it is not necessarily permissible to promote that product as Made in USA. The FTC considers additional factors to decide whether a product can be advertised or labeled as Made in USA.\nManufacturers and marketers should check with Customs to see if they need to mark their products with the foreign country of origin. If they don't, they should look at the FTC's standard to check if they can properly make a Made in USA claim.\nThe FTC has jurisdiction over foreign origin claims on products and in packaging that are beyond the disclosures required by Customs (for example, claims that supplement a required foreign origin marking to indicate where additional processing or finishing of a product occurred).\nThe FTC also has jurisdiction over foreign origin claims in advertising and other promotional materials. Unqualified U.S. origin claims in ads or other promotional materials for products that Customs requires a foreign country-of-origin mark may mislead or confuse consumers about the product's origin. To avoid misleading consumers, marketers should clearly disclose the foreign manufacture of a product.\nExample: A television set assembled in Korea using an American-made picture tube is shipped to the U.S. The Customs Service requires the television set to be marked \"Made in Korea\" because that's where the television set was last \"substantially transformed.\" The company's World Wide Web page states \"Although our televisions are made abroad, they always contain U.S.-made picture tubes.\" This statement is not deceptive. However, making the statement \"All our picture tubes are made in the USA\" - without disclosing the foreign origin of the television's manufacture - might imply a broader claim (for example, that the television set is largely made in the U.S.) than could be substantiated. That is, if the statement and the entire ad imply that any foreign content or processing is negligible, the advertiser must substantiate that claim or net impression. The advertiser in this scenario would not be able to substantiate the implied Made in USA claim because the product was \"substantially transformed\" in Korea.\nOther Statutes\nWhat are the requirements of other federal statutes relating to country-of-origin determinations?\nTextile Fiber Products Identification Act and Wool Products Labeling Act - Require a Made in USA label on most clothing and other textile or wool household products if the final product is manufactured in the U.S. of fabric that is manufactured in the U.S., regardless of where materials earlier in the manufacturing process (for example, the yarn and fiber) came from. Textile products that are imported must be labeled as required by the Customs Service. A textile or wool product partially manufactured in the U.S. and partially manufactured in another country must be labeled to show both foreign and domestic processing.\nOn a garment with a neck, the country of origin must be disclosed on the front of a label attached to the inside center of the neck - either midway between the shoulder seams or very near another label attached to the inside center of the neck. On a garment without a neck, and on other kinds of textile products, the country of origin must appear on a conspicuous and readily accessible label on the inside or outside of the product.\nCatalogs and other mail order promotional materials for textile and wool products, including those disseminated on the Internet, must disclose whether a product is made in the U.S., imported or both.\nThe Fur Products Labeling Act requires the country of origin of imported furs to be disclosed on all labels and in all advertising. For copies of the Textile, Wool or Fur Rules and Regulations, or the new business education guide on labeling requirements, call the FTC's Consumer Response Center\n(202-382-4357). Or visit the FTC online at www.ftc.gov. Click on Consumer Protection.\nAmerican Automobile Labeling Act - Requires that each automobile manufactured on or after October 1, 1994, for sale in the U.S. bear a label disclosing where the car was assembled, the percentage of equipment that originated in the U.S. and Canada, and the country of origin of the engine and transmission. Any representation that a car marketer makes that is required by the AALA is exempt from the Commission's policy. When a company makes claims in advertising or promotional materials that go beyond the AALA requirements, it will be held to the Commission's standard. For more information, call the Consumer Programs Division of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (202-366-0846).\nBuy American Act - Requires that a product be manufactured in the U.S. of more than 50 percent U.S. parts to be considered Made in USA for government procurement purposes. For more information, review the Buy American Act at 41 U.S.C. SSSS 10a-10c, the Federal Acquisition Regulations at 48 C.F.R. Part 25, and the Trade Agreements Act at 19 U.S.C. SSSS 2501-2582.\nWhat To Do About Violations\nWhat if I suspect noncompliance with the FTC's Made in USA standard or other country-of-origin mislabeling?\nInformation about possible illegal activity helps law enforcement officials target companies whose practices warrant scrutiny. If you suspect noncompliance, contact the Division of Enforcement, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580; (202) 326-2996 or send an e-mail to MUSA@ftc.gov. If you know about import or export fraud, call Customs' toll-free Commercial Fraud Hotline, 1-800-ITS-FAKE. Examples of fraudulent practices involving imports include removing a required foreign origin label before the product is delivered to the ultimate purchaser (with or without the improper substitution of a Made in USA label) and failing to label a product with a required country of origin.\nYou also can contact your state Attorney General and your local Better Business Bureau to report a company. Or you can refer your complaint to the National Advertising Division (NAD) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus by calling (212) 754-1320. NAD handles complaints about the truth and accuracy of national advertising.

", " Perhaps Walmart's products aren't as patriotic as they claim\nAccording to a report recently released by the advertising watchdog group, Truth in Advertising, over 100 products labeled on Walmart's website as \"Made in the USA\" are, in fact, imported from other countries.\nThe report found that both Walmart's store brand products, such as Equate makeup sponges and tooth whitening strips, as well as other brands, such as Almay eyeliner, were falsely labeled as made in the United States.\n\nSome products clearly displayed contrary information, such as a red, white, and blue \"made in the USA\" logo on the front, with the words \"Made in China\" displayed on the back. Other products were stamped with the patriotic logo while the product specifications listed the item as imported.\nWalmart had an excuse, but the labels are magically gone\nWhile there is no official certification process for labeling a product \"made in the USA,\" a company can still be sued for false advertising if they misuse the label. However, rather than taking legal action, Truth in Advertising simply sent a letter to Walmart CEO, Doug McMillon, causing the retail chain some embarrassment, but sparing them the court room drama.\nWalmart responded by saying that some manufacturing of its store brands had recently moved to the United States, but the website hadn't been update yet. However, many Made in USA labels were removed from the website after Truth in Advertising's letter went public. As for other brands, Walmart claims that the country of origin information comes from the supplier.\nGreat reminder to stay honest\nUnimpressed by these excuses, executive direction of Truth in Advertising, Bonnie Patten, says that the \"largest retailer in the world should have made sure its American-made claims were accurate before affixing made in USA labels on the products. Until Walmart cleans up this mess, consumers cannot rely on Walmart with regard to where a product is really made when shopping on the site.\"\nThe report also argues that the website's labels for \"Made in USA\" and \"Assembled in USA,\" with their tiny fonts and identical color schemes, are too similar to distinguish on the website, even though the Federal Trade Commission makes a clear differentiation between these two labels.\nAll of this is an important reminder for businesses to stay honest in advertising. All it takes is a watchdog with an internet connection and keen eye to uncover false claims. ", " While there is no official review process required for labeling a product as \"Made in the U.S.A.,\" a company can get into legal trouble for misusing that label, as doing so may constitute false advertising. A new report from an advertising watchdog group claims that Walmart's website has more than 100 examples of products incorrectly marketed as made in America.\nAccording to a letter [PDF] recently sent by the group Truth In Advertising to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, \"Walmart's website is mired in USA labeling errors.\"\nAmong the items singled out in the letter are Walmart's Equate store-brand makeup sponges in the image at the top of this story. TINA says these were given the Made in the U.S.A. label on Walmart.com even though the product's own packaging clearly states that they were \"Made in China.\"\nAnother Equate-brand product called out by TINA are these teeth-whitening strips that the company simultaneously lists as made in America while declaring in the product details that they are imported form outside the country:\n\nIn response to the TINA letter, Walmart told the group that manufacturing for both of these products was recently moved to the U.S. but that some stores may still contain versions made overseas and not all the information on the website is correct. Regardless, both items no longer carry the patriotic marketing message.\nIt wasn't just store-brand items that got the false \"Made in U.S.A.\" labels, according to the report. TINA's letter gives the example of an Almay eyeliner that states the product is made and assembled here in the U.S., even though the packaging declares that it is \"Made in Germany.\" Walmart says that the country of origin information comes from the supplier.\n\"False made in USA labeling on Walmart's website has misled consumers looking to purchase American-made products,'' said TINA.org Executive Director Bonnie Patten. \"The largest retailer in the world should have made sure its American-made claims were accurate before affixing made in USA labels on the products. Until Walmart cleans up this mess, consumers cannot rely on Walmart with regard to where a product is really made when shopping on the site.\"\n============\nUPDATE: When reached for comment, a rep for Walmart provided the following statement to Consumerist -\n\"We are continually working to improve our website listings and information. We are undertaking a more extensive quality assurance review to help eliminate these coding errors. Based on our initial internal review, we believe these errors are limited to a small percentage of items and we are confident in the overall integrity of the information on our website.\"\n============\nA more detailed report [PDF] commissioned by TINA looked at the actual \"Made in the U.S.A.\" labeling on Walmart.com and found a number of issues.\nThis report noted that Walmart does little to differentiate its \"Made in the U.S.A.\" label from its \"Assembled in the U.S.A.\" label, even though the two labels have very different standards in the eyes of the Federal Trade Commission.\n\"The legibility of the text at the top of the label, which can be either 'Made in the' or 'Assembled in the', is marginal even for people with excellent or corrected vision, due both to the text's small size and the low contrast of light blue text on a white background,\" writes the report's author, Dr. Jeff Johnson, who notes that the problem is exacerbated for farsighted people or those looking at the site on a small-format screen. \"If such people have not seen it earlier in larger format (e.g., on a product page), they would be unable to determine what it says. Even consumers who have seen that text already in larger format would, in search results, have trouble distinguishing 'Made in the USA' from 'Assembled in the USA'.\""], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "4524, 4839", "docSpanText": "Representations about entire product lines\nManufacturers and marketers should not indicate, either expressly or implicitly, that a whole product line is of U.S. origin (\"Our products are made in USA\") when only some products in the product line are made in the U.S. according to the \"all or virtually all\" standard."}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "4953, 5038", "docSpanText": "A company doesn't need approval from the Commission before making a Made in USA claim"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "16586, 16683", "docSpanText": "Stating Made in USA on the package would deceive consumers about the origin of the product inside"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "27256, 27387", "docSpanText": "any person (such as a competitor) who is damaged by a false designation of origin the right to sue the party making the false claim"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "304, 448", "docSpanText": "The FTC Act gives the Commission the power to bring law enforcement actions against false or misleading claims that a product is of U.S. origin."}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1750, 1915", "docSpanText": "There's no law that requires most other products sold in the U.S. to be marked or labeled Made in USA or have any other disclosure about their amount of U.S. content"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1926, 2076", "docSpanText": "manufacturers and marketers who choose to make claims about the amount of U.S. content in their products must comply with the FTC's Made in USA policy"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "9, 61;62, 270", "docSpanText": "Walmart's products aren't as patriotic as they claim<SPAN_SEP>According to a report recently released by the advertising watchdog group, Truth in Advertising, over 100 products labeled on Walmart's website as \"Made in the USA\" are, in fact, imported from other countries"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "137, 157", "docSpanText": "Truth in Advertising"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "490, 664", "docSpanText": "Some products clearly displayed contrary information, such as a red, white, and blue \"made in the USA\" logo on the front, with the words \"Made in China\" displayed on the back"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "666, 778", "docSpanText": "Other products were stamped with the patriotic logo while the product specifications listed the item as imported"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1046, 1117", "docSpanText": "Truth in Advertising simply sent a letter to Walmart CEO, Doug McMillon"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "490, 778", "docSpanText": "Some products clearly displayed contrary information, such as a red, white, and blue \"made in the USA\" logo on the front, with the words \"Made in China\" displayed on the back.

The opponents won out, though the term \"extremists\" remained; the FBI agreed with the call.

After the shooting, a manhunt, and late night police chase, Juarez was taken into custody and ultimately transferred to the Dallas County Jail very early Wednesday morning.\nOfficers Santander and Almeida both joined the Dallas Police Department there years ago, assigned to the Northeast Division.\nA source close to the investigation told CBS 11 News reporter J.D. Miles that Officer Santander was shot in the back of the head and Officer Almeida was shot in the face.\nWednesday morning Dallas police Sergeant Michael Mata, who is also president of the Dallas Police Association, said, \"When an officer is shot or killed or injured in one city, it affects every officer across the country. We are one huge family.\"\nThe shooting happened just after 4 p.m. Tuesday at the Home Depot store in the 11600 block of Forest Central Drive, near U.S. Highway 75 and Forest Lane, after the two police officers were called to help an off-duty officer.\nAccording to an arrest warrant affidavit, Dallas police Officer Seward was working off-duty at the store when Mr. Painter alerted him that a male customer was acting suspiciously in the store. Officer Seward detained the person, identified him as Armando Juarez, and discovered a felony warrant had been issued for him.\nOfficer Seward had called on-duty police officers to the scene and Officers Santander and Almeida responded. All of the police officers met in the store's loss-prevention office and then Officer Seward then went to Officer Santander and Almeida's squad car to look up the felony warrant for Juarez and confirm that was the person being detained inside.\nThe affidavit details how Officer Seward was returning to the building when he heard a \"shots fired\" broadcast over his police radio, proceeded inside and found Officers Santander and Almeida and Mr. Painter all on the floor of the loss-prevention office \"with apparent gunshot wounds.\"\nPolice say there was a witness inside the office who said he saw Juarez shoot all three people.\nImmediately after the shooting armed officers were seen in back of the Home Depot as employees and customers rushed out of the store and away from the area.\nA massive search for the suspect - including police helicopters and officers on the ground - followed after witnesses reported the shooter had fled on foot and may be hiding in a nearby creek. But when police reviewed security camera video they discovered Juarez fled from the scene in a white-colored work truck. It was then police put out a description of the truck - that had \"GX4\" on the back fender, a ladder rack, and large exhaust pipes rising from the front - and issued a be on the lookout (BOLO) alert.\nPolice later spotted the truck, with Juarez and a female passenger inside, in Southeast Dallas and gave chase. Officers were ultimately able to corner Juarez in a residential neighborhood near Dallas Love Field Airport and took the 29-year-old man into custody. The unidentified woman was also detained. It isn't know if she is facing any charges.\n\"We got our man,\" Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said at a late-night news conference.\nMoments after Juarez was taken into custody, Chief Hall thanked the officers on a radio call.\n\"Base to all units: Excellent work, excellent work. Thank everybody for their diligence in this matter. Appreciate you so very much and we're still praying for our brother and sister,\" she said.\nA number of officers continue to hold vigil at Presbyterian Dallas hospital. \"Most of the family that is coming is already here,\" Mata said. \"Obviously, they're holding on the best they can. This [being shot] is something I think all [police] families realize they could be facing. But when it happens, you never want it to be you.\"\nAt the time of his arrest Juarez had an outstanding warrant for Felony Theft. With the death of Officer Santander, Juarez has now been charged with Capital Murder in addition to the charge of Aggravated Assault on a Public Servant for the shooting of Officer Almeida. He remains in jail on a $1.1 million bond. ", " Law enforcement officers stand guard at the driveway entrance to the emergency room at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas.

(Associated Press)\nDALLAS (AP) - A Dallas police officer died Wednesday after a shooting that wounded another officer and an employee at a home improvement store, the city's mayor said.\nMayor Mike Rawlings was presiding over a city council meeting when he announced the death of Rogelio Santander, a member of the police force for three years. Santander, officer Crystal Almeida and a loss-prevention officer for Home Depot were shot Tuesday by a man identified by police as 29-year-old Armando Luis Juarez.\nThe two officers and the store loss-prevention officer underwent surgery for their injuries after the shooting in the north of the city, Dallas Police Chief U. Renee Hall said late Tuesday.\nAlmeida and the loss-prevention officer, who hasn't been identified, were in critical condition Wednesday.\nPolice arrested Juarez following a high-speed car chase. He's being held at the Dallas County jail on charges of aggravated assault on a public servant and felony theft. He was taken into custody shortly before 10 p.m.\n\"We got our man,\" Rawlings said at a late-night news conference at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas.\nBut relatives of Juarez said they couldn't believe he would be involved in such a violent episode.\n\"There's no way my son could've done this,\" Ruben Juarez told The Dallas Morning News, adding that he didn't think his son owned any guns.\nArmando Juarez's grandmother, Janie Longoria, told reporters Tuesday that her grandson is a \"sweet, lovable person,\" but that his friends are a bad influence.\n\"And I told him to stay away from those people,\" she said.\nPolice were called to the store to help an off-duty police officer to remove Juarez from the store. Police have not said if he was suspected of shoplifting or why he was being ejected from store. Juarez opened fire as he was being escorted from the store and made his escape. Several law enforcement agencies were involved in the pursuit that led to his eventual arrest.\nRawlings said late Tuesday that he remains \"upset at the lack of respect for our police in this city and in our country.\"\nIn 2016, four Dallas police officers and a transit officer were shot dead by a sniper in an ambush that came toward the end of a peaceful protest over the police killings of black men in other cities.\nJuarez was arrested in January on a charge of unlawful use of a motor vehicle after authorities say he was found in a stolen vehicle.

A Gallup poll released on Friday showed that U.S. registered voters, by 46 percent to 38 percent, are more likely to vote for an unnamed Republican presidential candidate than for Obama in 2012. Obama recently called himself the \"underdog\" in the race.\nBundlers raised about a third of Obama's war chest so far.\nEarlier on Friday, Republican Mitt Romney posted $14 million for the quarter, second to fellow Republican Texas Governor Rick Perry's $17 million. Obama's comparable fundraising figure for the three months was $43 million.\nObama voluntarily releases a list of bundlers. No other major candidate has done so.\nThe president regularly brings in more than $1 million in a single evening of fundraising, as supporters donate the legal maximum of $35,800 to his campaign and the Democratic party for the chance to have dinner and take a picture with the president.\nUBS executive Robert Wolf and hedge fund executive Orin Kramer are also big Obama fundraisers.\n'Doing well with small donors'\nAt least 40 percent of all the money raised by the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee last quarter came from those giving in increments of $200 or less.\nThe Obama campaign has been touting its connections to mainstream Americans who send smaller checks, calling itself a grassroots effort.\n\"They are still doing well with small donors,\" said Darrell West, director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a thank tank.\nThe campaign said that in the third quarter about 600,000 people donated to the campaign.\nMuch has been made of dipping support among Wall Street for Obama. Some financial executives, including hedge fund managers, have complained about Obama's tax and financial regulation policies and his comments about the wealthy, at times calling them \"fat cats.\"\nIn the second quarter, more Wall Street money did flow to Romney, who has deep ties there. Still, Obama boosted the number of bundlers with Wall Street ties in that period.\nThe Republican candidates' reports, due Saturday, offer the first broad look at their financial health.\nThey are the first official tallies of donations and expenses for contenders Perry, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman and businessman Herman Cain, who said he raised $2.8 million this quarter.\nRomney, a former Massachusetts governor, had nearly $15 million on hand in addition to the roughly $14 million in contributions during the July-September period that he reported Friday.\nPerry, who briefly surged to the top of the Republican presidential field this summer, has roughly the same in the bank.\nNot counting major support from Republican-leaning super political action committees, the virtual tie between Romney and Perry for cash on hand means the two have similar amounts to spend on ads and travel just months before heading into key primary states.\nPerry is expected to dig into his campaign funds to buy TV ads to Romney's record on health care, abortion, gay rights and job creation. His campaign suggested this week that the moment for a barrage of attack ads was near.\nRomney, the former governor of a predominantly Democratic state, has been attacked for his shifting positions on social issues that are held dear by conservative voters who dominate the Republican primary season. ", " It is no secret that the relationship between President Obama and Wall Street has chilled. A striking measure of that is the latest campaign finance reports.\nMitt Romney has raised far more money than Mr. Obama this year from the firms that have been among Wall Street's top sources of donations for the two candidates.\nThat gap underscores the growing alienation from Mr. Obama among many rank-and-file financial professionals and Mr. Romney's aggressive and successful efforts to woo them.\nThe imbalance exists at large investment banks and hedge funds, private equity firms and commercial banks, according to a New York Times analysis of the firms that accounted for the most campaign contributions from the industry to Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama in 2008, based on data from the Federal Election Commission and the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.\nIt could widen as Mr. Obama, seeking to harness anger over growing income inequality, escalates his criticism of the industry, after a year spent trying to smooth ties bruised by efforts to impose tougher regulations.\nSince this spring, Mr. Romney has raised $1.5 million from employees of firms like Morgan Stanley; Highbridge Capital Management, a hedge fund; and Blackstone, a private equity firm. Mr. Obama has raised just over $270,000 from firms that were among his leading sources of campaign cash in 2008.\nEmployees of Goldman Sachs, who in the 2008 campaign gave Mr. Obama over $1 million - more than donors from any other private employer in the country - have given him about $45,000 this year. Mr. Romney has raised about $350,000 from the firm's employees.\nThose figures do not account for all Wall Street giving, nor for the full force of each candidate's robust network of Wall Street \"bundlers,\" wealthy individuals who raise money from friends, family members and business associates. And Mr. Obama continues to dominate Mr. Romney - and the rest of the Republican field - in overall fund-raising. He has raised close to $100 million so far this year for his campaign, three times more than Mr. Romney, as well as $65 million for the Democratic National Committee.\nThe gap in Wall Street giving to Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney underscores disenchantment with Mr. Obama in the industry and the challenges both candidates will face in grappling with public anger about the financial world.\nFor much of the last year, aides to Mr. Obama have sought to mollify Wall Street executives still bristling over the president's criticisms of their profits and bonuses, while defending the administration's program of tougher oversight and regulation as both necessary and beneficial to the industry in the long term.\nBut with Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who once ran the private equity firm Bain Capital, the candidate many in Mr. Obama's camp believe is his most likely Republican opponent next fall, Mr. Obama's campaign appears to sense an opportunity to harness public resentment over an industry that has largely thrived while the rest of the economy has not.\n\"There's no doubt that Governor Romney has raised money off of his belief that Wall Street should be allowed to write its own rules again by repealing Wall Street reform,\" said Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman. \"The president put in place protections to ensure that the financial crisis is not repeated and that unacceptable risks aren't taken with Americans' life savings.\"\nFor his part, Mr. Romney is now pitching himself as the turnaround expert for an ailing national economy. He has personally wooed major Wall Street donors, successfully recruiting several senior financial executives poised to back Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey had he opted for a White House bid.\nBut anger at big banks - manifested by the growing Occupy Wall Street protests in New York City and elsewhere - is palpable enough that Mr. Romney must avoid being seen as a friend of an industry that many Americans blame for onerous bank fees and underwater mortgages."], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "0, 74", "docSpanText": "The number of donors who raise big money for President Barack Obama jumped"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "191, 271", "docSpanText": "At least 41 people have raised at least half a million dollars for the president"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "273, 363", "docSpanText": "compared to 27 in Obama's first report, according to an analysis of campaign data released"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1162, 1272", "docSpanText": "\"The emphasis has been on doing larger dollar fundraising events particularly asking for $2,500,\" Corrado said"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1275, 1396", "docSpanText": "Events like this help him to raise substantial amounts of money for the campaign allowing him to exceed his pace for 2007"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "3612, 3702", "docSpanText": "\nIn the second quarter, more Wall Street money did flow to Romney, who has deep ties there"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1098, 1260", "docSpanText": "Mr. Romney has raised $1.5 million from employees of firms like Morgan Stanley; Highbridge Capital Management, a hedge fund; and Blackstone, a private equity firm"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1262, 1301", "docSpanText": "Mr. Obama has raised just over $270,000"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1375, 1458;1461, 1565", "docSpanText": "Employees of Goldman Sachs, who in the 2008 campaign gave Mr. Obama over $1 million<SPAN_SEP>more than donors from any other private employer in the country - have given him about $45,000 this year"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1567, 1630", "docSpanText": "Mr. Romney has raised about $350,000 from the firm's employees."}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "159, 321", "docSpanText": "Mitt Romney has raised far more money than Mr. Obama this year from the firms that have been among Wall Street's top sources of donations for the two candidates.\n"}], "summary": "President Obama's big-money \"bundlers\" are on the rise, with at least 41 supporters now having raised more than $500,000 each for the president, reports MSNBC.

And the justices are already facing a batch of petitions involving the rights of religious institutions to opt out of providing contraception under Obamacare.\nBoth issues seem likely to land on this term's docket, although the justices haven't formally taken up either.\nMany in the Obama administration would also like to see the court weigh in on immigration in coming months, upholding the president's right to grant quasi-legal status and work permits to millions of immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally as children.\nBut it's unclear whether that fight will get to the justices in time for a decision this term or whether Obama's effort to expand his executive actions on immigration will remain blocked by a lower court order until the president leaves office.\nHere's POLITICO's look at five of the most important cases the justices could grapple with soon:\nA potential body blow to labor\nPublic-employee unions and politicians of both parties are keenly focused on a California dispute about whether states can compel government employees to pay union dues. A loss for the unions could sharply diminish the clout of a movement already struggling with its political relevance.\nThe case, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, was brought by Orange County, Calif. schoolteacher Rebecca Friedrichs and other teachers, who are arguing that forcing them to pay union dues violates their First Amendment rights. They also contend that unions should have to get permission before collecting dues used for political purposes, as opposed to the current system that requires objecting employees to opt out.\n\"The significance is substantial, either way it comes out,\" said University of California at Irvine Law Professor Catherine Fisk. \"The reason why conservative lawyers are bringing these case is the hope that a significant number of government employees choose not to join the union and certain government employee unions will be weaker.\"\nThe Roberts court has not been friendly to unions, issuing a 5-4 ruling last year that prohibited mandatory union fees for home health workers but stopped short of banning so-called \"agency shops\" in government.\nThe new case directly asks the justices to overturn a 38-year-old precedent that allows all workers covered by union negotiations to be charged for representation.\nHow the case will be resolved is unclear, partly because the conservative justices often see limits on government employee's First Amendment rights when their speech is at issue. Fisk said the unions are \"rationally fearful\" about what the court will do, but she thinks the justices might end up dumping the case after it's heard. \"I think the case raises so many doctrinal problems for them,\" she said.\n\nHigher ed affirmative action back in the crosshairs\nTwo years after punting the case back to an appeals court, the justices will take a second crack at resolving a dispute about the constitutionality of the University of Texas at Austin's affirmative action program. The case was brought by rejected applicant Abigail Fisher, who contends she was rejected because of her race.\nThe last time Fisher's case went before the high court, affirmative action opponents hoped it would serve as a vehicle to pare back preferences for racial and ethnic groups at government-run schools. However, the justices instead told the 5th Circuit it had been too deferential to the University of Texas's claims that the programs were narrowly tailored to promote diversity. Justice Anthony Kennedy won the support of six other justices for a decision that said such programs must be handled with \"strict scrutiny,\" but the decision did not suggest they were automatically unconstitutional.\nJustice Elena Kagan has recused herself because she was involved in the case during her previous service as solicitor general. The real question is whether Kennedy will join the four other Republican appointees in setting such a high bar for affirmative action that many public colleges will abandon the preferences and admissions practices they use to achieve racial and ethnic diversity.\n\nThe meaning of \"one person, one vote'\nA Texas case has the potential to deal a blow to Latino political clout, tilting the balance of power away from urban areas and towards suburban and rural areas with more white voters. Evenwel v. Abbott presents the question of whether state legislative districts can be apportioned using a count of eligible voters rather than a count of all people.\nIf immigrants (both illegal and legal) as well as children can be left out of the count, \"the rural areas where voters tend to have fewer non-citizens or where there are fewer young people concentrated would necessarily gain,\" said New York University Law Professor Rick Pildes. \"It's a reasonable inference if the urban areas are more Democratic leaning that they would lose power to more Republican rural areas.\"\nCongressional redistricting shouldn't be directly affected by the case, Pildes said, because the Constitution says the U.S. census used for that reapportionment should be based on each state's population. But others say the ruling could spill over into Congressional redistricting down the line.\n\nReligious nonprofits and Obamacare\nIn the Hobby Lobby case last year, the justices allowed for-profit companies to seek religious exemptions from Obamacare's coverage requirements. But now, several religious-affiliated schools and institutions -including the Little Sisters of the Poor nursing home in Denver - have filed lawsuits, too.\nThey argue that the administration's process for allowing religious nonprofits to opt out of the contraception requirement requires them to violate their religious beliefs. The Supreme Court has eight petitions - including one that just arrived from the federal government - on this issue.\nSome prominent judges are effectively begging the Supreme Court to jump in by lamenting the refusal of some courts to protect the largely-Catholic religious entities from sanctions for failing to fill out paperwork that triggers the contraception exemption but also sets in motion coverage from others.\n\"How ironic that this most consequential claim of religious free exercise, with literally millions of dollars in fines and immortal souls on the line, should be denied when nearly every other individual religious freedom claim has been upheld by this court,\" 5th Circuit Judge Edith Jones complained in a dissent last week. \"How tragic to see the humiliation of sincere religious practitioners, which, coming from the federal government and its courts, implicitly denigrates the orthodoxy to which their lives bear testament. And both ironic and tragic is the harm to the Judeo-Christian heritage whose practitioners brought religious toleration to full fruition in this nation. Undermine this heritage, as our founders knew, and the props of morality and civic virtue will be destroyed.\"\nThe justices haven't signaled which of the challenges, if any, they'll consider but are expected to do so in the coming weeks.\n\nTesting when abortion clinic regulations go too far\nTwo of the latest tactics in the abortion wars could wind up before the justices this term: requirements that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and that abortion clinics meet standards for hospitals or surgical centers.\nAn appeals court has upheld most such limits in Texas, but in June the Supreme Court voted, 5-4, to block key parts of the law until the justices decide whether to weigh in. Petitions to take up that case and a similar law in Mississippi are already pending at the Supreme Court.\nSupporters of the laws say they are designed to protect women's health, but abortion providers and abortion rights advocates say the laws would force many clinics to close and penalize poor women who could not afford travel to distant clinics.\nA similar Wisconsin law led to combative oral arguments in front of the 7th Circuit last week. Judge Richard Posner suggested the law was a transparent effort to prevent abortions, not aid women.\n\"Governor Walker, before he withdrew from the presidential competition, said he thought abortion should be forbidden even if the mother dies as a result, \" Judge Richard Posner said to a lawyer for the state, in remarks first reported by the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. \"Is that kind of official Wisconsin policy?\"\n\"That perhaps is Governor Walker's personal view, but it's not a state policy,\" Assistant Attorney General Brian Keenan replied. Keenan insisted requiring doctors to have admitting privileges was a reasonable precaution to aid women.\n\"The admitting privileges would benefit the continuity of care for the woman when she goes to that hospital,\" he said.\nPosner said the fact that the law was intended to kick in one business day after it was passed made clear the authors' intentions. \"That statute can't be justified in terms of women's health,\" the judge said.\nJennifer Haberkorn contributed to this report.\n", " The new term's biggest rulings will land in June, as the 2016 presidential campaign enters its final stretch, and they will help shape the political debate.\n\"Constitutional law and politics are certainly not the same thing, but they are interrelated, never more so than in a presidential election year that will likely determine who gets to appoint the next justice or two or three,\" said Vikram D. Amar, dean of the University of Illinois College of Law.\nBy the time the next president is inaugurated, Justice Stephen G. Breyer will be 78, Justices Scalia and Kennedy will be 80, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be 83.\n\"This coming term will again put into focus that the court is divided along partisan lines and that the 2016 presidential elections will be hugely consequential in shaping constitutional and other law for perhaps a generation or more,\" said Neal E. Devins, a law professor at William & Mary.\nThe current court is the first in history split along partisan lines, where the party of the president who appointed each justice is a reliable predictor of judicial ideology. Put another way, all five Republican appointees are to the right of all four Democratic appointees. It was not long ago that Republican appointees like Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter routinely voted with the court's liberal wing.\nAs a consequence of the current alignment, Professor Devins said, \"the Roberts court has generated more marquee decisions divided by party alignment than all other courts combined.\"\nThe last term's big cases did not for the most part follow that pattern because Justice Kennedy, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan and sits at the court's ideological fulcrum, voted with the court's liberal wing at an unusually high rate.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\"The story of the last term is that the left side of the court did a lot of winning,\" said Irving L. Gornstein, the executive director of Georgetown's Supreme Court Institute.\n\"This term,\" he added, \"I would expect a return to the norm, with the right side of the court winning a majority but by no means all of the big cases, with Justice Kennedy again the key vote.\"\nThe cases on unions and affirmative action, for instance, were almost certainly added to the docket by the more conservative justices in the confidence that they would be able to move the law to the right. Both cases were created by legal entrepreneurs and brought on behalf of plaintiffs recruited by conservative groups.\nPhoto\nThe case on unions, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, No. 14-915, may deal a blow to organized labor. \"It could set the stage for a Citizens United-style reconsideration in the area of union dues,\" said John P. Elwood, a lawyer at Vinson & Elkins, referring to the 2010 decision that transformed campaign finance law.\nThe new case takes aim at a compromise fashioned by the court in 1977 in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education.\nIn Abood, the court said public workers who decline to join a union can nevertheless be required to pay for the union's collective bargaining efforts to prevent freeloading and ensure \"labor peace.\" But nonmembers, the court went on, cannot be forced to pay for the union's purely political activities, as that would amount to forbidden compelled speech under the First Amendment.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\nThe California teachers who brought the new case say t collective bargaining is itself political, as it concerns public policy on spending, seniority, class size and the like. Unions respond that the case is a First Amendment Trojan horse designed to further weaken the power of organized labor.\nThe unions have reason to be nervous. The court has twice signaled that it may be ready to overrule Abood notwithstanding the doctrine of stare decisis, Latin for \"to stand by things decided.\" Justice Alito, the court's leading critic of Abood, offered a joking alternative definition in public remarks last month.\n\"It is a Latin phrase,\" he said. \"It means 'to leave things decided when it suits our purposes.' \"\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe case on unions is not the only sequel on the docket.\nIn Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, No. 14-981, the court will return to the subject of whether the Constitution permits public colleges and universities to take account of race in admissions decisions.\nIn 2013, in a short, vague compromise ruling in the case, the court refused to decide whether the admissions plan at the University of Texas at Austin - which combines race-neutral and race-conscious tools to achieve diversity - is constitutional. The court's return to the subject after an appeals court sustained the hybrid plan has struck many supporters of affirmative action as an ominous sign.\nThe case was brought by the Project on Fair Representation, a small conservative advocacy group that successfully mounted a challenge to the Voting Rights Act in 2013. The group is also behind this term's most important case on voting, Evenwel v. Abbott, No. 14-940, which asks the court to address the meaning of \"one person, one vote.\"\nThe court has never resolved whether state voting districts should have the same number of people, including unauthorized immigrants, children and others not eligible to vote, or the same number of voters. Allowing states to count only voters would in many parts of the country shift political power from cities to rural areas, a move that would generally benefit Republicans.\nOn the last day of the term in June, Justices Breyer and Ginsburg announced that they had grave doubts about the constitutionality of the death penalty and seemed to invite a broad challenge. It has not yet arrived, and it is hardly clear that a majority would be receptive to such a challenge.\nThe new term does have an unusually high number of capital cases presenting more focused issues, including a challenge to Florida's sentencing scheme, Hurst v. Florida, No. 14-7505, and a case on race discrimination in jury selection, Foster v. Chatman, No. 14-8349.\nThe court has not heard an abortion case since 2007, when it upheld the federal Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. That seems about to change.\nThe most likely candidate is a challenge to a Texas law that threatens to reduce the number of abortion clinics in the state to about 10, down from more than 40. Should the court agree to hear the case, Whole Woman's Health Center v. Cole, No. 15-274, it is likely to produce the most important abortion ruling since 1992, when Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion identified in Roe v. Wade in 1973.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nThe question in the Texas case is whether two parts of a 2013 state law imposed an \"undue burden\" on the constitutional right to abortion. One part of the law requires all clinics in the state to meet the standards for \"ambulatory surgical centers,\" including regulations concerning buildings, equipment and staffing. The other requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.\nAn appeals court largely upheld the contested provisions, but the Supreme Court in June, by a 5-to-4 vote, stepped in to block the ruling while it considered whether to hear the case.\nThat suggests three things: that the court is likely to hear the case, that its decision will be closely divided and that the ruling will land in June, thrusting a volatile and divisive issue into the middle of the presidential race. ", " WASHINGTON-The death penalty is shaping up to be a big issue for the Supreme Court as it begins a new term Monday, with at least six capital-punishment cases on the docket and a recent wave of executions keeping the justices up late to field last-minute appeals.\nIn the weeks ahead, the court is set to hear arguments over the constitutionality of capital sentences in Florida, Georgia, Kansas and Pennsylvania.

The court-which is divided 5-4 for conservatives, but saw Justice Roberts vote liberal on Obamacare and same-sex marriage-will look at cases including unions, affirmative action, and possibly abortion. A primer: Unions: Since 1977, unions have been allowed to charge non-union workers for dues that go to collective bargaining efforts, but not political ones. Now California teachers have brought a case saying collective bargaining is itself political. \"It could set the stage for a Citizens United-style reconsideration in the area of union dues,\" a lawyer says. Affirmative Action: Abigail Fisher says that being white played a role in the University of Texas denying her admission back in 2008. The Supreme Court punted on her case in 2013, and now it's back on the docket. Like the unions case, this was brought by a conservative group that recruited the plaintiffs. The death penalty: Justices will decide on capital-punishment cases in Pennsylvania, Kansas, Georgia, and Florida, the Wall Street Journal reports. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer have already expressed doubts about whether capital punishment is constitutional. \"One person, one vote\": Should state legislative districts be drawn based on their number of people or eligible voters? If justices choose the latter-leaving out immigrants and children-Latinos could lose political clout and rural areas will gain, Politico reports. Abortion: Justices may opt to revisit a Texas law that could reduce the state's abortion clinics from more than 40 to roughly 10.

Three other people were also injured in the incident.\nMelquan was taken to the Children's Hospital of Georgia where he was pronounced dead at 9:56 p.m. His body will be taken to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation lab for an autopsy Tuesday.\nDon Clark, a Robinson family friend and Melquan's former coach, said the child's parents are trying to go through the grieving process. Melquan was their firstborn and one of three children.\n\"They're definitely upset over the fact of how could this happen, with the fact that there were so many children,\" Clark said. \"You can play the what ifs in many different scenarios and it will never get any better. The fact that this situation happened with so many kids out here, it's heartbreaking.\"\nClark said Melquan was very protective of his siblings and loved his family, which makes the situation that much tougher. Clark feels that it might be hard for his siblings to deal with the loss of their brother because of how young they are.\nAccording to a statement from the city of Augusta, which owns and operates the community center and athletic complex, three other people were injured in the accident.

Bowen will primarily focus on the death, while the city will look into how the live electrical wire happened.\nGeorgia Power released a statement saying it will work with local officials as they conduct the investigation.\n\"Georgia Power's condolences and sympathies are with the individuals and their families following last night's tragic event at Fleming Athletic Complex,\" the statement says. \"Our preliminary investigation indicates that Georgia Power does not control or maintain the voltage that energized the fences at the complex.\"\nMelquan was a seventh-grader at Morgan Road Middle School, according to Kaden Jacobs, the Richmond County school system's director of communications.\n\"Our thoughts are with the family during this difficult time,\" Jacobs said. \"We have provided additional support to Morgan Road Middle School for students and staff.\"\nAll football activities have been canceled for the rest of the week at Fleming Park, according to a spokesperson for the complex.\nClark said more details will be provided in the future on how the community can help.\n\"We lost a future leader,\" he said. \"We lost a future athlete.

We manufacture hand grips that offer arthritis and back pain relief and reduce the risk of repetitive strain injuries including Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and tendinitis.\n\nMotus grips are a snow shovel accessory that make snow shovels easier to work with. Use the D-grip and the T-grip on shovels, scoops, pushers and roof rakes. The ergonomic design adjusts to any stature, short or tall, left or right-handed.\nThe D-grip mounts mid-way down the handle and gives lifting leverage to the forward hand. The T-grip mounts at the upper end of the handle and gives pushing and pulling control to the back hand. In combination, they optimize their mechanical advantage.\n\n\n\n There are two main actions that take place when working with snow shovels:\n\nLifting is involved in the use of snow and scoop shovels.\nBiomechanically, lifting involves the body as a third class lever.\nAdding the D-grip mid-way down the shovel handle moves the fulcrum to the lower hand, transferring the effort to the long end of the shovel, making it a first class lever.\nWith increased leverage, the user may now lift a heavier load with greater ease.\nPushing & Pulling is involved in the use of snow pushers and roof rakes.\nAdding the D-grip mid-way down the handle improves posture by allowing the user to stand taller with less back bend.\nLimb alignment and hand position with the D-grip are more neutral, reducing the risk of repetitive stress injury.\nNeutral limb alignment and hand position also reduce fatigue and blisters.\n\n\n\n Adding the T-grip handle at the upper end allows a greater range of motion.\nA straight line of force from the shoulder to the grip opens the space between the shoulders for good posture and reduced risk of back and muscle strain.\nNeutral limb alignment and hand position help reduce arthritis and back pain.\n\n\n\n\nA Case Study Assessment of MOTUS Power-Grip Products\nby Dean Kriellaars, Ph.D.,\nUniversity of Manitoba, School of Medical Rehabilitation\nMay 20, 1992\n\nI. Description\n\nStraight Grip (T-grip)\nThe straight grip provides a fixed hand placement at right angle to the implement shaft.\n\nD-ring Handle (D-grip)\nThe d-ring handle provides a hand placement site, which is slightly displaced from the implement shaft. The d-ring can be positioned at any angle relative to the shaft but is typically positioned close to a right angle to the shaft.\n\nII. Method\n\nA pseudo-static, biomechanical assessment of the straight grip Power-Grip product was undertaken in case study fashion for a simple shoveling task. The Newtonian equations for static equilibrium were developed to estimate the trunk joint moment required to hold a load with and without the straight hand-grip. A dynamic and EMG analysis was not undertaken.\n\nIII. Results for the Straight Grip\n\nA. This hand-grip permits the wrist angle to remain in a near neutral position in the ulnar/radial plane. The amount of ulnar deviation is limited to a maximum of 10 degrees as compared to 35 degrees (near the end of range of motion) without the use of the straight grip.\n\nIn lifting with an implement, the wrist can undergo maximum ulnar deviation during a specific period. This results in compression of the tissues located on the ulnar side of the wrist (the ulnar nerve, blood supply, carpal ligaments, tendons, etc.) and tension in the radially located tissues. Prolonged or repetitive loading of a joint at the end of range of motion can be deleterious to the tissues. In the mid-range of a joint, the muscles can operate efficiently to bear the load, however, in the end of range of motion, the passive tissues bear a disproportionate amount of the load since the muscles are in a compromised position. The decreased ulnar deviation resulting from the use of the straight grip is beneficial to the structures in and about the wrist.\n\nB. The hand-grip requires the forearm to be in a pronated position.\n\nWithout the use of the straight grip, the forearm would be in a supinated position. This positioning influences the set of muscles recruited to perform the task. Most notably, with the forearm in a supinated position, the biceps brachii can operate to control the amount of supination and is in an advantaged position to aid in elbow flexion. When the straight grip is used, the forearm is positioned in pronation. This positioning results in a different muscle strategy to be employed during the lifting task. The biceps brachii is positioned in a relatively lengthened position and the forearm extensors and forearm supinators are required to control the degree of pronation. The difference in lifting with the straight grip represents a substitution of muscles required to perform the task. An electromyographical analysis would be required to establish the precise muscle activation pattern. This may limit the amount of elbow flexion used to perform the task enabling the user to incorporate larger trunk and lower limb musculature.\n\nC. The change in wrist position and forearm pronation results in an increased shoulder abduction angle (5-10 degrees).\n\nThe change in wrist position requires the shoulder to be abducted. The lifting task normally involves the use of shoulder abductors. When the straight grip is used the starting angle for the abduction movement is greater. The change in joint angle would alter the muscle activation pattern required to perform the task. It is possible to speculate that the supraspinatus muscle, which is claimed to account for the first 5 degrees of abduction, would not be involved in the abduction when the straight grip is employed, instead the larger deltoid muscles would be primarily involved. This may result in a decreased likelihood of tendinitis (or similar disorder) of the intrinsic shoulder muscles. This speculation would have to be examined with electromyographical analysis.\n\nD. The change in upper limb kinematics (joint angles) due to the hand-grip reduces the trunk flexion angle in the neighborhood of 5 degrees.\n\nThe kinematics of the upper limb holding on to the straight grip allows the trunk to remain in a more upright position during a lifting task. This results in a decreased effort from the extensor muscles of the hip and back since they do not have to work as hard to hold up the weight of the trunk. These muscles do not have to work as hard since there is i) a decrease in the moment of the weight of the upper body due to a decrease in the moment arm, and ii) a decrease in the moment of the weight of the load (that being lifted) due to a decrease in the moment arm are (the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the weight force acting vertically downward to the specific axis of rotation, say the L4 vertebral axis). This decrease in the moment of the load and upper body weight would be in the order of 5%. For repetitive tasks this small decrease would result in substantial energy savings and may result in less cumulative trauma.\n\n\n\n E. The change in upper body kinematics (joint angles) allows the load borne by the implement to be carried closer (about 5 cm) in the para-sagittal plane to the joint axes of rotation, most notable the hip and lumbar vertebral axes, as well as the upper limb axes (shoulder and elbow).\n\nSimilar to point D., when the lifted load is carried closer to the body this results in a decrease in the moment arm of the load relative to the body's axes of rotation (hip, lumbar, shoulder, etc.). The decrease in moment arm reduces the tendency of the load to rotate downward which proportionately relieves the muscles from having to rotate the load upward. The magnitude of this effect is between 3 and 5 %.\n\nThe overall reduction in load arising from the decrease in trunk angle and the closer load carrying is near 10%. This is a substantial amount, not only for repetitive tasks, but also for a single execution of a task. This would be beneficial for prevention and rehabilitation of low back injuries.\n\n\n\n F. The hand-grip did not result in an observable change in lower limb kinematics.\n\nThe method employed in this study did not permit accurate evaluation of lower limb kinematics. A video motion analysis would be required for this purpose.\n\n\n\n G. The hand-grip constrains the user to a specific set of lifting postures.\n\nThis constraint arises from the fact that the user must hold the grip and since the grip is fixed on the implement shaft the user's upper limbs are required to maintain a fixed geometry during lifting. Any task executed repetitively results in specific muscle fatigue, as such it may be beneficial to allow the user to rest or the freedom to adopt different postures to perform the same task which results in a substitution of non-fatigued muscles for the fatiguing muscles. This factor is primarily related to user understanding of proper lifting concepts and is not actually limited by the straight grip (i.e. changing the position of the straight grip periodically).\n\n\n\n H. The straight grip was found to fit any of the 14 different implements tested independent of:\n\n1. material (plastic, metal or wood),\n2. shaft diameter\n3. the presence of water (rain).\n\nThe straight grip was found to loosen or tighten somewhat with variations in temperature. The user would be advised to check that the grip is secure before each use.\n\n\n\n I. The hand-grip reduces the potential for blister formation.\n\nThe kinematics of lifting without the hand-grip involves movement of the hand relative to the shaft resulting in skin surface shear which leads to blistering. With the use of the straight grip the magnitude of skin surface shear may be less which would result in a decrease in blister formation.\n\n\n\n\nCASE STUDY ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\"hand-grip permits the wrist angle to remain in a near neutral position\"...\"beneficial to the structures in and about the wrist.\"\n\"enabling the user to incorporate larger trunk and lower limb musculature.\"\n\"decreased likelihood of tendinitis (or similar disorder) of the intrinsic shoulder muscles\"\n\"remain in a more upright position during a lifting task\"...\"substantial energy savings and may result in less cumulative trauma.\"\n\"The overall reduction in load arising from the decrease in trunk angle and the closer load carrying is near 10%.

Typically it's posed by a woman standing with hands on hips and assuming a Thurberesque mien as she gazes down on a man exercising his thumb on the remote but otherwise in repose. The correct answer: \"It might.\"\nSnow-shovel design may not rank up there with the Three Gorges Dam as an engineering challenge, but it kills more than 10 times as many people each year. My Slate colleague Juliet Lapidos has observed that the 1,200 annual heart-failure deaths attributed to blizzards represent only about 0.3 percent of all annual deaths from heart disease. But that's a lot more people than die from watching a football game (though that poses health risks too). You can say all these shovelers should exercise more, and that's certainly true. But such advice is of little help to a sedentary soul whose doorstep is suddenly buried in a four-foot drift.\nAdvertisement\n\nThe science of shoveling was invented by the Progressive Era efficiency expert (and father of Taylorism) Frederick Winslow Taylor. Taylor observed laborers shoveling varying weights and concluded that the shovel load with which \"a first class man would do his biggest day's work\" was about 21 pounds. That's remarkably close to the current recommendation from Canada's Center for Occupational Health and Safety (keep per-shovel snow loads below 24 pounds). At the Bethlehem Steel works in Pennsylvania, Taylor gave out shovels specifically designed to hold 21 pounds-small ones for shoveling iron ore, big ones for shoveling ash-and made \"thousands of stop-watch observations\" to calculate the most efficient shoveling method.\nTaylor's purpose was not to preserve workers' health but to maximize output; by following his recommendations, Bethlehem was able to increase the daily weight shoveled by each laborer from 16 to 59 tons. But because physical endurance was a necessary component to maximizing output, Taylor's shoveling method also reduced wear and tear on the human body. \"[T]his is not nigger driving,\" Taylor said (that's how Progressives talked in 1911); \"this is kindness; this is teaching; this is doing what I would like mighty well to have done to me if I were a boy trying to learn how to do something.\" He recommended that workers\npress the forearm hard against the upper part of the right leg, just below the thigh ... take the end of the shovel in your right hand and when you push the shovel into the pile, instead of using the muscular effort of your arms, which is tiresome, throw the weight on the body of the shovel ... [T]hat pushes your shovel in the pile with hardly any exertion and without tiring the arms in the least.\nReading Taylor's recommendations, one is struck by two significant changes in American life. One is that 100 years later African-Americans are considered human beings whose physical well-being concerns society (at least in theory) as much as that of Caucasians. The other change is that, even taking into account that Taylor's subjects were all experienced manual laborers, people must have had much stronger backs back then.\nLike Slate on Facebook.

How to avoid such a tragic fate? Well, for starters, keep your per-shovel load to 24 pounds or less. Beyond that, however, the recommendations get muddled, notes Timothy Noah on Slate: Shovels that make it easier to gather the snow make it harder to lift the snow, and vice versa. There is one obscure shovel supposedly better suited to both parts of the job, but good luck finding one in a hardware store. A few other things will lessen your risk: Don't start shoveling while snow is still falling (it's colder, so you'll put additional strain on your heart); don't bundle up too much (getting too hot isn't good, either); and don't drink coffee (it increases your heart rate) or hot cocoa (who knows why?) right before shoveling. If that all sounds like too much trouble, \"wait till someone younger or poorer than you knocks on your door and offers to shovel your walk for $20 or $30,\" Noah recommends. \"Delegate.

For that to happen the Kenya Wildlife Service needs to bring in external vets and translocation specialists from other countries - Namibia, for example.\"\nThe relocation of endangered animals - known as translocation - involves putting them to sleep for the journey and then reviving them in a process that carries risks. But the loss of half of them is highly unusual.\n\nThe black rhinos were moved from the Nairobi and Lake Nakuru national parks to a new sanctuary created in Tsavo East national park in an operation announced by Najib Balala, the Kenyan tourism minister and carried out in collaboration with WWF Kenya.\nIn a statement the ministry said its preliminary investigations suggested the rhinos had died of salt poisoning as they tried to adapt to saltier water in their new home. It suspended the ongoing move of other rhinos and said the surviving ones were being closely monitored.\n\"The eight dead rhinos were among those that had been moved to the sanctuary in an initiative to start a new population in line with the National Rhino Conservation and Management Strategy,\" the ministry said. \"This kind of mortality rate is unprecedented in Kenya Wildlife Service operations.\"\n\"A total of 14 rhinos had been planned to be translocated.\nIt was the first time since the 1990s that black rhinos had been moved to Tsavo East, which originally had a population of nearly 2,000, according to Save the Rhino, but now has between 10 and 20.\n\nKahumbu said officials must take responsibility and explain what went wrong. \"Rhinos have died. We have to say it openly when it happens, not a week later or a month later,\" she said. \"Something must have gone wrong, and we want to know what it is.\"\nKenya wants to increase its black rhino population to 2,000 by creating populations in areas that provide the right habitat for the animals to thrive.\nDean said translocation was not as common in Kenya as in other southern African countries, such as Namibia.\n\"In Kenya, they do it every three to four years, whereas other countries are doing them every year,\" she said.\n\"There needs to be a postmortem and we need to look at the whole protocol for translocation.\"\nThe ministry said it had invited an external expert from South Africa to join its investigation and if negligence was found to be a contributory factor disciplinary action would be taken.\n\"We will make the investigation results public as soon as we receive them,\" the statement said.\nAccording to KWS figures, nine rhinos were killed in Kenya last year. In May, three more were shot dead inside a specially protected sanctuary in northern Kenya and had their horns removed. In March, the last male northern white rhino on the planet, an older bull named Sudan, was put down by Kenyan vets after becoming ill.

(Associated Press)\nNAIROBI, Kenya (AP) - Eight critically endangered black rhinos are dead in Kenya after wildlife workers moved them from the capital to a new national park, the government said Friday, calling the toll \"unprecedented\" in more than a decade of such transfers.\nPreliminary investigations point to salt poisoning as the rhinos tried to adapt to saltier water in their new home, the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife said in a statement, describing how the animals likely became dehydrated and drank more salty water in a fatal cycle.\nThe ministry suspended the ongoing move of rhinos and said the surviving ones in the new park were being closely monitored.\nThe loss is \"a complete disaster,\" said prominent Kenyan conservationist Paula Kahumbu of WildlifeDirect.\nConservationists in Africa have been working hard to protect the black rhino sub-species from poachers targeting them for their horns to supply an illegal Asian market.\nIn moving a group of 11 rhinos to the newly created Tsavo East National Park from Nairobi last month, the Kenya Wildlife Service said it hoped to boost the population there. The government agency has not said how the rhinos died. Fourteen of the animals were to be moved in all.\n\"Disciplinary action will definitely be taken\" if an investigation into the deaths indicates negligence by agency staff, the wildlife ministry said.\n\"Moving rhinos is complicated, akin to moving gold bullion, it requires extremely careful planning and security due to the value of these rare animals,\" Kahumbu said in a statement. \"Rhino translocations also have major welfare considerations and I dread to think of the suffering that these poor animals endured before they died.\"\nTransporting wildlife is a strategy used by conservationists to help build up, or even bring back, animal populations. In May, six black rhinos were moved from South Africa to Chad, restoring the species to the country in north-central Africa nearly half a century after it was wiped out there.\nKenya transported 149 rhinos between 2005 and 2017 with eight deaths, the wildlife ministry said.\nAccording to WWF, black rhino populations declined dramatically in the 20th century, mostly at the hands of European hunters and settlers. Between 1960 and 1995 numbers dropped by 98 percent, to fewer than 2,500.\nSince then the species has rebounded, although it remains extremely threatened. In addition to poaching the animals also face habitat loss.\nAfrican Parks, a Johannesburg-based conservation group, said earlier this year that there are fewer than 25,000 rhinos in the African wild, of which about 20 percent are black rhinos and the rest white rhinos.\nIn another major setback for conservation, the last remaining male northern white rhino on the planet died in March in Kenya, leaving conservationists struggling to save that sub-species using in vitro fertilization.\n___\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa"], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "580, 585;597, 607;614, 672;690, 712", "docSpanText": "Eight<SPAN_SEP>endangered<SPAN_SEP>rhinos are dead in Kenya after wildlife workers moved them<SPAN_SEP>to a new national park"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1211, 1297", "docSpanText": "The loss is \"a complete disaster,\" said prominent Kenyan conservationist Paula Kahumbu"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "828, 930", "docSpanText": "investigations point to salt poisoning as the rhinos tried to adapt to saltier water in their new home"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "932, 1085", "docSpanText": "the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife said in a statement, describing how the animals likely became dehydrated and drank more salty water in a fatal cycle"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1087, 1099;1141, 1209", "docSpanText": "The ministry<SPAN_SEP>said the surviving ones in the new park were being closely monitored"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1087, 1136", "docSpanText": "The ministry suspended the ongoing move of rhinos"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1354, 1361;1367, 1377;1398, 1484", "docSpanText": "working<SPAN_SEP>to protect<SPAN_SEP>species from poachers targeting them for their horns to supply an illegal Asian market"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1486, 1503;1588, 1658", "docSpanText": "In moving a group<SPAN_SEP>the Kenya Wildlife Service said it hoped to boost the population there"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "90, 95;117, 127;134, 184;194, 199", "docSpanText": "Eight<SPAN_SEP>endangered<SPAN_SEP>rhinos have died after being moved to a reserve in<SPAN_SEP>Kenya"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "128, 168;235, 296", "docSpanText": "black rhinos have died after being moved<SPAN_SEP>in what one conservationist described as \"a complete disaster"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "311, 415", "docSpanText": "investigations pointed to salt poisoning as the rhinos tried to adapt to saltier water in their new home"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2233, 2353", "docSpanText": "investigations suggested the rhinos had died of salt poisoning as they tried to adapt to saltier water in their new home"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "3914, 4007", "docSpanText": "We will make the investigation results public as soon as we receive them,\" the statement said"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2355, 2400", "docSpanText": "It suspended the ongoing move of other rhinos"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1717, 1753;1869, 1930", "docSpanText": "The relocation of endangered animals<SPAN_SEP>carries risks.

When the saltier water made the rhinos thirsty, they likely drank even more, possibly leading to their deaths, the country's Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife said in a statement. The rhinos were among 11 moved to the park, and officials said the surviving animals are being closely monitored. The planned relocation of other rhinos to the park has been suspended. As the Guardian notes, the Save the Rhino organization estimates the total world population of black rhinos at around 5,500. The species is targeted by poachers who aim to collect their horns for the black market in Asia. Moving endangered animals from one sanctuary to another is called translocation and is done in hopes of establishing healthy populations in new areas.

Nearly all those in attendance appeared to be for the move and about a dozen spoke in support of it.\n\"Many proposed laws are unconstitutional and deny us our God-given rights,\" said Gabe Garrison of Happy Camp. \"We need our own state so we can make laws that fit our way of life.\"\nAmong those in attendance was Erin Ryan, field representative for Rep.\nAdvertisement\nDoug LaMalfa.

(April 23) AP\nSurgeons at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine announced Monday that they have performed the first total penis and scrotum transplant on an American military veteran. (Photo: Getty Images)\nA U.S. serviceman severely injured several years ago in an IED blast in Afghanistan has received the world's first total penis and scrotum transplant, surgeons at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine announced Monday.\nThe man, whose identity was not released, is recovering well and expected to regain both urinary and sexual function, Richard Redett, who led the transplant team, said at a Monday telephone news conference.\nThe patient did not receive testicles from his donor to avoid the ethical issues that might ensue if he later had children, said Damon Cooney, another transplant team member. The testicles would have contained sperm from the recently deceased donor.\nThe donor was not identified, nor was his cause of death, but in a statement, his family praised the sergeant's service to his country and noted the donor family includes a number of veterans.\n\"We are so thankful to say that our loved one would be proud and honored to know he provided such a special gift to you,\" said the statement, read by Alexandra Glazier, president and CEO of New England Donor Services, which arranged for the donation. \"We hope you can return to better health very soon and we continue to wish you a speedy recovery.\"\nTwo years ago, surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital performed a more limited transplant on a penile cancer patient. That patient, Thomas Manning, continues to do well, though his sexual function hasn't fully recovered yet, said Curtis Cetrulo, who runs the reconstructive transplantation program at Massachusetts General. The hospital has yet to conduct another penile transplant, as it awaits funding and other logistical issues, he said.\nThere have also been several successful penile transplants in South Africa, as well as an unsuccessful one in China.\nThe Johns Hopkins surgery, performed in a 14-hour procedure in late March, was the most extensive yet, involving more tissue than has been previously transplanted, the surgeons said.\nIn addition to a large skin graft covering part of the sergeant's abdomen, penis and scrotum, surgeons connected three arteries, four veins and two nerves to provide blood flow and sensation to the donated tissue. His internal organs were not severely damaged by the blast.\nRedett said he expects the patient will regain the ability to urinate by the time he leaves the hospital later this week. It will take about six months for the nerves to regrow enough to restore sexual function and sensation, but Redett said he is optimistic that will take place.\nJohns Hopkins covered the cost of the procedure, and hopes to complete more in the near future, said W. P. Andrew Lee, who directs the hospital's Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.\nThe hospital does not plan to use the procedure for gender reassignment surgery, he said.\nOnce it becomes more routine, penile transplantation is likely to cost about the same as a liver transplant, said L. Scott Levin, chairman of orthopedic surgery and a professor of plastic surgery at Penn Medicine. (One recent estimate puts the total cost of a liver transplant in the United States above $800,000.) It is still an open question who will pay for such procedures, Levin said.\nAnother major issue in transplantation is rejection. The recipient's body may reject the donated tissue at any time, so the Johns Hopkins patient will have to be on continuous therapy to tamp down his immune system, said Gerald Brandacher, who handled the immune aspects of the Johns Hopkins transplant.\nTo reduce the risk of rejection, the patient was also infused with bone marrow from the donor. This approach has been used in eight other patients who received transplants, such as arms, that were transformative but not lifesaving. Balancing the donor's bone marrow with the recipient's allows the patient to take only one low-dose medication a day instead of the three typically taken by transplant patients, Brandacher said.\nInjuries that affect sexual and urinary function can be devastating to a person's identity, self-esteem and intimate relationships, said Lee, whose department has been preparing for penile transplantations since 2013.\n\"We believe that genital-urinary transplantation can help those warriors with missing genitalia, just as hand and arm transplants transformed the lives of amputees,\" he said.\nAt Massachusetts General, publicity surrounding the penile transplant encouraged other patients with genitourinary tissue damage to seek care.\n\"We've had many people who are really despondent come out of the shadows and get worked up,\" Cetrulo said.\nEven if they weren't transplant candidates they have now been helped in other ways, Cetrulo said, noting many people with these conditions consider suicide, and suffer even more emotional pain than people in need of arm or face transplants.\nHopefully, the Johns Hopkins' patient will inspire others to seek help, Cetrulo said. \"That's one of the most incredible and important contributions of this case, not only to this individual whose life has probably been saved.\"\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2vDM2Nt ", " WASHINGTON (AP) - A veteran who lost his genitals from a blast in Afghanistan has received the world's most extensive penis transplant, and doctors said Monday he is recovering well and expected to leave the hospital this week.\nSaying they wanted to address \"an unspoken injury of war,\" Johns Hopkins University surgeons rebuilt the man's entire pelvic region - transplanting a penis, scrotum and part of the abdominal wall from a deceased donor - in a highly experimental 14-hour operation last month.\nSuch transplants \"can help those warriors with missing genitalia just as hand and arm transplant transformed the lives of amputees,\" Dr. W.P. Andrew Lee, Hopkins' chairman of plastic and reconstructive surgery, told reporters Monday.\nThe patient, who asked to remain anonymous, is expected to recover urinary and, eventually, sexual function.\nThe scrotum transplant did not include the donor's testicles, meaning reproduction won't be possible. \"We just felt there were too many unanswered ethical questions\" with that extra step, said Hopkins' Dr. Damon Cooney.\nThree other successful penis transplants have been reported, two in South Africa and one in 2016 at Massachusetts General Hospital. Those transplants involved only the penis, not extensive surrounding tissue that made this transplant much more complex.\nThe loss of a penis, whether from cancer, accident or war injury, is emotionally traumatic, affecting urination, sexual intimacy and the ability to conceive a child. Many patients suffer in silence because of the stigma their injuries sometimes carry.\nDoctors sometimes reconstruct the form of a penis from a patient's own skin, usually to treat congenital abnormalities or during transgender surgery. That requires using implants to achieve erection.\nFor a functional penis transplant, surgeons must connect tiny nerves and blood vessels. Candidates face some serious risks, including rejection of the tissue and side effects from anti-rejection drugs that must be taken for life.\nBut penis transplants have generated intense interest among veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, and a few years ago Hopkins surgeons began planning and rehearsing how to perform such a complex operation in patients with widespread tissue damage. The Department of Defense Trauma Registry has recorded 1,367 male service members who survived with genitourinary injuries between 2001 and 2013. It's not clear how many victims lost all or part of the penis.\nHopkins is screening additional veterans to see if they are good candidates for this type of reconstructive transplant. Finding donors is an additional hurdle: In the U.S., people or their families who agree to donate organs such as the heart or lung must be asked separately about also donating a penis, hand, face or other body part.\nThe Hopkins patient received an extra experimental step, an infusion of bone marrow from his donor that research suggests may help a recipient's immune system better tolerate a transplant. Surgeons said that is enabling the veteran to take one anti-rejection drug instead of several.\nIn a statement from Hopkins, the patient was quoted as saying: \"When I first woke up, I felt finally more normal.\"\n___\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

(Photo: Michael Sears / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)\nAnissa Weier plans to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect in the Slender Man stabbing case next week.\nWeier's co-defendant, Morgan Geyser, had already entered such a plea, often referred to as NGI, at a hearing last month.\nAt the time, prosecutors pressed the judge to inquire whether Weier might go the same route, since it requires the court to appoint doctors to examine the defendant and report whether their condition would support the plea. One of Weier's attorneys, Maura McMahon, said the defense had not yet decided.\nBut in a pleading filed this week, McMahon indicated that Weier now wants to change her not guilty plea to the insanity plea.

Tuesday marks one month since the plane vanished. Once the beacons blink off, locating the black boxes in such deep water would be an immensely difficult, if not impossible, task.\nUp to 14 planes and 14 ships are scouring the 30,000-square-mile search zone.\nThe wait has been devastating for weary families, CBS News correspondent Seth Doane reports. Many insist the search continues at all costs, despite the frustrations.\nIt is unclear whether a sub on board the Ocean Shield will be deployed to try to chart out any debris on the sea floor when searchers are certain the black boxes' locator beacons have gone silent. If the sub maps out a debris field, the crew will replace the sonar system with a camera unit to photograph any wreckage.\n\nHouston's comments about deploying the sub contradicted an earlier statement from Australia's acting prime minister, Warren Truss, who said search crews would launch the Bluefin 21 autonomous sub on Tuesday.\nThe towed pinger locator detected late Saturday and early Sunday two distinct, long-lasting sounds underwater that are consistent with the pings from an aircraft's \"black boxes\" - the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, Houston said, dubbing the find a promising lead in the month-long hunt for clues to the plane's fate.\nStill, officials warned it could take days to determine whether the sounds were connected to Flight 370, which vanished March 8 on a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing with 239 on board.\n\"This is an herculean task - it's over a very, very wide area, the water is extremely deep,\" Defense Minister David Johnston said. \"We have at least several days of intense action ahead of us.\"\nHoutson said finding the sound again was critical to narrowing down the search area before the sub can be used. If the vehicle went down now with the sparse data collected so far, it would take \"many, many days\" for it to cover all the places the pings might have come from.\n\"It's literally crawling at the bottom of the ocean, so it's going to take a long, long time,\" Houston said.\nDespite the excitement surrounding the Ocean Shield's sound detections, Houston warned that the search had previously been marred by false leads - such as ships detecting their own signals. Because of that, other ships cannot be sent in to help with the underwater search, as they may add unwanted noise.\n\"We're very hopeful we will find further evidence that will confirm the aircraft is in that location,\" Houston said. \"There's still a little bit of doubt there, but I'm a lot more optimistic than I was one week ago.\"\nFinding the black boxes is key to unraveling what happened to the Boeing 777, because they contain flight data and cockpit voice recordings that could explain why the plane veered so far off-course.\n\"Everyone's anxious about the life of the batteries on the black box flight recorders,\" said Truss, who is acting prime minister while Tony Abbott is overseas. \"Sometimes they go on for many, many weeks longer than they're mandated to operate for - we hope that'll be the case in this instance. But clearly there is an aura of urgency about the investigation.\"\nThe first sound picked up by the equipment on board the Ocean Shield lasted two hours and 20 minutes before it was lost, Houston said. The ship then turned around and picked up a signal again - this time recording two distinct \"pinger returns\" that lasted 13 minutes. That would be consistent with transmissions from both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder.\nThe black boxes normally emit a frequency of 37.5 kilohertz, and the signals picked up by the Ocean Shield were both 33.3 kilohertz, U.S. Navy Capt. Mark Matthews said. But the manufacturer indicated the frequency of black boxes can drift in older equipment.\nHouston said the frequency of the sounds heard was considered \"quite credible\" by the manufacturer, and noted that the frequency from the Air France jet that crashed several years ago was 34 kilohertz. Pressure from being so deep below the surface and the age of the batteries can also affect the transmission level, he said.\nThe frequency used by aircraft flight recorders was chosen because no other devices use it, and because nothing in the natural world mimics it, said William Waldock, a search-and-rescue expert who teaches accident investigation at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.\nBut these signals are being detected by computer sweeps, and \"not so much a guy with headphones on listening to pings,\" said U.S. Navy spokesman Chris Johnson. So until the signals are fully analyzed, it's too early to say what they are, he said.\n\"We'll hear lots of signals at different frequencies,\" he said. \"Marine mammals. Our own ship systems. Scientific equipment, fishing equipment, things like that. And then of course there are lots of ships operating in the area that are all radiating certain signals into the ocean.\"\nThe Ocean Shield is dragging a ping locator at a depth of 1.9 miles. It is designed to detect signals at a range of 1.12 miles, meaning it would need to be almost on top of the recorders to detect them if they were on the ocean floor, which is about 2.8 miles deep.\nMeanwhile, the search for any trace of the plane on the ocean's surface continued Tuesday. It is taking place 1,400 miles northwest of the Australian west coast city of Perth, with good weather predicted, said the Joint Agency Coordination Center, which is overseeing the operation.\nOne-hundred-thirty-three missions have been completed so far in the hunt from the air for debris that could be from Flight 370, but no debris from the plane has been found.

A fast response craft from Australian Defence Vessel Ocean Shield tows Able Seaman Clearance Diver Michael Arnold as he searches the ocean for debris in the search zone in the southern Indian Ocean for the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 in this picture released by the Australian Defence Force April 8, 2014.\nSYDNEY/PERTH, Australia (Reuters) - An Australian ship which picked up possible \"pings\" from the black box recorders of a missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner has been unable to detect any further signals and time is running out to narrow the massive search, officials said on Tuesday.\nAngus Houston, head of the Australian agency coordinating the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, said the month-long hunt in the Indian Ocean was at a critical stage given the batteries in the black box beacons had already reached the end of their 30-day expected life.\nA U.S. Navy \"towed pinger locator\" onboard Australia's Ocean Shield picked up two signals consistent with black box locator beacons over the weekend - the first for more than two hours and the second for about 13 minutes.\nHouston said the signals represented the best lead in the search yet, but efforts to pick up the pings again had so far been unsuccessful.\n\"If we don't get any further transmissions, we have a reasonably large search area of the bottom of the ocean to prosecute and that will take a long, long time. It's very slow, painstaking work,\" said Houston.\nThe black boxes record cockpit data and may provide answers about what happened to the plane, which was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew when it vanished on March 8 and flew thousands of kilometers off its Kuala Lumpur-to-Beijing route.\nAuthorities say evidence, including the loss of communications, suggests the plane was deliberately diverted by someone familiar with the aircraft, but have not ruled out mechanical problems.\nAnalysis of satellite data led investigators to conclude the Boeing 777 came down in an area some 1,680 km (1,040 miles) northwest of Perth, near where possible pings were picked up and the search is now focused.\nBLUEFIN ON HOLD\nAn autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) named Bluefin-21 is onboard the Ocean Shield and could be sent to look for wreckage on the sea floor, but narrowing the search zone first was critical, Houston said.\n\"It is a large area for a small submersible that has a very narrow field of search, and of course, it is literally crawling along the bottom of the ocean,\" he said.\n\"That's why it's so important to get another transmission and we need to continue until there's absolutely no chance the (black box) device is still transmitting.\"\nThe Bluefin will scour the ocean floor in 20-hour missions using sonar in an attempt to find the aircraft, before its findings are downloaded and analyzed on board the Ocean Shield.\nIf anything unusual is spotted, the sonar on board the robotic vehicle will be replaced with a camera to take a closer look. The potential search area is about 4.5 km (2.8 miles) deep, the outer reach of the Bluefin's range.\nSome 133 missions have been completed so far in the multinational aerial hunt for debris in the southern Indian Ocean and would continue, officials said.\nUp to 11 military planes, three civilian planes and 14 ships planned to take part in the search on Tuesday, with good weather in the search area. But so far, searchers have only turned up fishing gear and other detritus.\n\"Even after the black box is found, the surface search will continue because they're looking for evidence to investigate why the aircraft went down,\" Lieutenant Commander Adam Schantz, the officer in charge of U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon search unit, told Reuters.\n\"So, we'll continue for a while trying to find anything on the surface that might give a reasoning behind the accident.\"\n(Additional reporting by Jane Wardell in Sydney and Anuradha Raghu in Kuala Lumpur; Editing by Dean Yates and Michael Perry)"], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "20, 32;79, 115;489, 493", "docSpanText": "Search crews<SPAN_SEP>have failed to relocate faint sounds<SPAN_SEP>were"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "404, 413;440, 505", "docSpanText": "equipment<SPAN_SEP>has picked up no trace of the signals since they were first heard"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "538, 567", "docSpanText": "Time may have already run out"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "576, 647", "docSpanText": "the devices, whose locator beacons have a battery life of about a month"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1826, 1926", "docSpanText": "Houston said, dubbing the find a promising lead in the month-long hunt for clues to the plane's fate"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2652, 2689;2691, 2703", "docSpanText": "it's going to take a long, long time,<SPAN_SEP>Houston said"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2597, 2647;2691, 2703", "docSpanText": "It's literally crawling at the bottom of the ocean<SPAN_SEP>Houston said"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "363, 529", "docSpanText": "An Australian ship which picked up possible \"pings\" from the black box recorders of a missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner has been unable to detect any further signals"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "791, 887", "docSpanText": "the batteries in the black box beacons had already reached the end of their 30-day expected life"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2312, 2324;2553, 2655", "docSpanText": "Houston said<SPAN_SEP>we need to continue until there's absolutely no chance the (black box) device is still transmitting.\"\n"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1251, 1409;1446, 1459", "docSpanText": "If we don't get any further transmissions, we have a reasonably large search area of the bottom of the ocean to prosecute and that will take a long, long time<SPAN_SEP>said Houston."}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2327, 2408", "docSpanText": "It is a large area for a small submersible that has a very narrow field of search"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2655, 2760", "docSpanText": "The Bluefin will scour the ocean floor in 20-hour missions using sonar in an attempt to find the aircraft"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2121, 2153;2177, 2187;2205, 2260", "docSpanText": "An autonomous underwater vehicle<SPAN_SEP>is onboard<SPAN_SEP>and could be sent to look for wreckage on the sea floor"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2425, 2489", "docSpanText": "it is literally crawling along the bottom of the ocean,\" he said"}], "summary": "When an Australian ship heard pings possibly from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, officials saw a big lead open up in the search-but since then, investigators haven't been able to recapture the signal, Reuters reports.

To some of the few who did, the meetings could trigger politically damaging comparisons to Nancy Reagan's use of astrology,\" Woodward wrote.\nMrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Lisa Caputo, is quoted in the Sun-Times as saying the first lady's interest in Houston is no secret.\nWoodward says anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson, daughter of famed anthropologist Margaret Mead, joined her in sessions of imaginary conversations.\nWoodward is an assistant managing editor at The Washington Post. As a reporter, he helped break the Watergate scandal with Carl Bernstein.\nMrs. Clinton herself wrote about her imaginary conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt in her June 10 column. She said she talked to Roosevelt about the role of a first lady.\n\"She usually responds by telling me to buck up, or at least to grow skin as thick as a rhinoceros,\" Mrs. Clinton wrote.\nIn the column, she described Houston as an expert on philosophy and mythology. \"(Houston) has shared her views with me on everything from the ancient Greeks to the lives of women and children on Bangladesh,\" she wrote.\nMrs. Clinton also acknowledged her relationship with Bateson.\n\"She and I have spent hours discussing the ways in which women in different societies attempt to fulfill their responsibilities to their families, jobs and communities,\" Mrs. Clinton wrote.\nRelated stories: ", " Meadville, PA (16335)\nToday\nCloudy with snow showers becoming a steady accumulating snow later on.

", " A woman's Fitbit clocked a rapid rise in her heart rate before a sudden drop-off to nothing, helping San Jose police piece together clues and charge her 90-year-old stepfather with her murder, according to court records.\nAdvertisement\nTony Aiello was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of murdering his 67-year-old stepdaughter, Karen Navarra, on Sept. 8. Aiello is married to Navarra's 92-year-old mother.\n\nNavarra, a pharmacy technician described by family as a \"recluse,\" was discovered deceased by a co-worker Sept. 13 after she failed to show up to her job.\nPolice said Navarra was found slumped over in a chair, clutching a large kitchen knife with a \"gaping\" slit to her neck. To investigators, the scene appeared to be staged to look like a suicide.\nBut a later autopsy revealed \"multiple deep and intrusive wounds\" to her head and facial area, most likely inflicted by a small hatchet or ax. The doctor told investigators Navarra couldn't have inflicted the wounds herself and classified the case as a homicide.\nAt his initial interview, Aiello told San Jose police that he dropped by Navarra's home on Saturday, Sept. 8, to bring her pizza, according to court records. He also said he was outside his own home a few hours later, and witnessed his step-daughter drive by and honk with someone else in the passenger seat.\nBut police say Aiello's account didn't match up with what they saw on surveillance footage.\nNearby cameras captured his car at Navarra's home for at least 21 minutes that day, between 3:12 p.m. and 3:33 p.m, but they didn't show her car ever leaving in the direction Aiello described, police said.\nInvestigators noted Navarra was wearing a Fitbit, a wristband device that can collect data like number of steps walked and heart rate, when she was found, and they later consulted with the company to see if the device could offer any clues. A company employee told police Navarra's heart rate spiked at 3:20 p.m. Sept. 8 and then rapidly slowed. The device stopped registering a heartbeat at 3:28 p.m.\nAiello repeated his initial story after his arrest and denied that he killed his stepdaughter, according to court records. When confronted with the Fitbit evidence Aiello suggested someone else could have been in the home. He told police she couldn't have died when he was there, because she walked him to the door.\nPolice also found clothes in his hamper covered in blood splatter. Aiello told police he cuts himself frequently, according to court records.\nHomicide investigators across the country have turned to fitness trackers to help piece together timelines, movements and other key information for their cases.\nA Connecticut man was arrested after his wife's Fitbit data showed her last movements were more than an hour after her husband said she had been killed by intruders.\nIn Wisconsin, another man's Fitbit acted as an alibi. The device corroborated his story during a crucial window of time when police said his live-in girlfriend's body was being dumped in a field.\nAiello is being held without bail and is due in court Oct. 4.\nAlertMe"], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "0, 166;268, 293", "docSpanText": "A 90-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly killing his stepdaughter after investigators gained information from the Fitbit she wore at the time of the incident<SPAN_SEP>67-year-old Karen Navarra"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "584, 733", "docSpanText": "A medical examiner determined Navarra couldn't have caused all the wounds herself and detectives believed the scene was staged to appear as a suicide"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1773, 1949;2557, 2619", "docSpanText": "Police also checked surveillance video near Navarra's home and determined Aiello's car was parked in his stepdaughter's driveway from 3:12 p.m. to at least 3:33 p.m. on Sept. 8<SPAN_SEP>surveillance video indicating that his car was in the driveway"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1376, 1404;1464, 1567", "docSpanText": "Navarra had a Fitbit Alta HR<SPAN_SEP>The data showed a significant spike in her heart rate Sept. 8 at 3:20 p.m., followed by a rapid slowing"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2051, 2057;2129, 2188", "docSpanText": "Aiello<SPAN_SEP>confirmed he was at his stepdaughter's home at about 3 p.m."}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2457, 2639", "docSpanText": "During the interview, Aiello was confronted about the information from Fitbit and the corresponding surveillance video indicating that his car was in the driveway,\" the document said"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2642, 2809", "docSpanText": "After explaining the abilities of the Fitbit to record time, physical movement and heart rate data,\" investigators told Aiello his stepdaughter had died before he left"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2815, 2821;2874, 2930", "docSpanText": "Aiello<SPAN_SEP>suggested that someone else might have been in the house"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "3023, 3080;3279, 3375", "docSpanText": "police found two shirts with blood splatter in his garage<SPAN_SEP>Aiello indicated that he might have cut his hand and shaken it while he was wearing those shirts"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "804, 866", "docSpanText": "Anthony Aiello, who is married to Navarra's 92-year-old mother"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1970, 2036", "docSpanText": "Aiello, of San Jose, was arrested and charged with murder Sept. 25"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "3669, 3748;3750, 3795;3863, 3921", "docSpanText": "This isn't the first time a Fitbit was used as evidence to make a murder arrest<SPAN_SEP>Richard Dabate is accused of killing his wife<SPAN_SEP>the victim's Fitbit data contradicted what he told police,"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "189, 364", "docSpanText": "When authorities responded to a welfare check Sept. 13 at the San Jose home of 67-year-old Karen Navarra, they found her dead at the scene, the San Jose Police Department said"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "366, 523", "docSpanText": "She had a gaping laceration on her neck, a deep laceration on her head and a kitchen knife in her hand, according to the statement of facts written by police"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1, 192", "docSpanText": "A woman's Fitbit clocked a rapid rise in her heart rate before a sudden drop-off to nothing, helping San Jose police piece together clues and charge her 90-year-old stepfather with her murder"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "512, 680", "docSpanText": "Sept. 13 after she failed to show up to her job.\nPolice said Navarra was found slumped over in a chair, clutching a large kitchen knife with a \"gaping\" slit to her neck"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "682, 754", "docSpanText": "To investigators, the scene appeared to be staged to look like a suicide"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1332, 1418;1420, 1502", "docSpanText": "police say Aiello's account didn't match up with what they saw on surveillance footage<SPAN_SEP>Nearby cameras captured his car at Navarra's home for at least 21 minutes that day"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2151, 2249", "docSpanText": "When confronted with the Fitbit evidence Aiello suggested someone else could have been in the home"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2344, 2456", "docSpanText": "Police also found clothes in his hamper covered in blood splatter.

The nature of his cooperation isn't clear. Patten worked with Manafort and on Ukrainian campaigns, and reportedly worked on microtargeting operations with Cambridge Analytica.\nMueller's office referred the prosecution to U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu in the District of Columbia, according William Miller, a spokesman for Liu, who declined to comment about the nature of the cooperation or other matters relating to an ongoing investigation.\nPatten appeared in federal court in Washington on Friday.\nPatten's plea agreement also included the suggestion that the Trump Inaugural Committee improperly accepted funds from a foreigner. Patten admitted that he illegally helped a Ukrainian oligarch buy a ticket to Trump's swearing-in through a straw-man donor, though as part of his cooperation agreement he wasn't charged.\nA onetime State Department official under President George W. Bush, Patten headed the Moscow office of the International Republican Institute in the early 2000s. A Russian employee of IRI at the time, Konstantin Kilimnik, went on to work as a fixer for Manafort in Ukraine and is a business partner with Patten.\nKilimnik has been indicted in absentia alongside Manafort on obstruction of justice charges. Manafort, who was one of President Donald Trump's campaign chairmen, was found guilty this month in Alexandria, Virginia, of tax and bank fraud charges and is being held in jail. He's due to stand trial in Washington next month on the obstruction charges as well as charges of money laundering and failure to register for his own lobbying work in Ukraine.\nManafort's Second Trial Looms, and There May Still Be Third\nPatten entered his plea before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, the same judge who's overseeing Manafort's money-laundering and obstruction of justice trial in Washington, scheduled to start next month.\nWatching from the gallery was Andrew Weissmann, an expert on money laundering and complex fraud cases who will be the lead prosecutor in Manafort's trial in Washington. Also in attendance was Scott Claffee, a trial lawyer in the Justice Department's National Security Division.\nFrom 2014, Patten provided a \"prominent\" Ukrainian oligarch who isn't named in court papers and his Opposition Bloc political party with lobbying and consulting services, according to the criminal information. A company Patten co-owned with a Russian national received more than $1 million for the work, the U.S. said.\nDetails about the Ukrainian oligarch match those of Sergei Lyovochkin, an Opposition Bloc leader whom prosecutors have previously identified as funding Manafort's work in Ukraine. He couldn't immediately been reached for comment.\nAs part of his lobbying work, Patten violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act by not disclosing the work to the U.S., prosecutors said. No date has been set for his sentencing.\nCambridge Analytica\nPatten worked for multiple political parties and office-holders in Ukraine, according to his website. His work for Cambridge Analytica came during the 2014 election cycle, the Daily Beast reported in April. It was later adopted by \"at least one major U.S. presidential candidate,\" the Daily Beast said. Patten told the publication that his work for Cambridge Analytica was separate from the work of his consulting firm.\nCambridge Analytica Files U.S. Bankruptcy After Data Scandal\nPatten formed a consulting firm in 2015 with Kilimnik, whom Mueller indicted in June. Kilimnik has been identified in filings as having worked for the Russian military's intelligence service known as the GRU. One filing cited an FBI assessment that his relations to the GRU continued through the 2016 election, which Kilimnik has denied.\nThe firm that the two set up, Begemot Ventures International Ltd., listed Patten and Kilimnik as the sole officers, according to its Washington, D.C., incorporation records. The company's website describes it as \"a strategic and political advisory firm that helps its clients win elections, strengthen political parities, build the right arguments before domestic and international audiences and achieve better results.\"\nBegemot, which is Russian for behemoth, matches details of the unidentified firm that prosecutors say received cash for Patten's Ukraine work.\nPatten registered with Congress in 2016 to lobby for a group called the Committee to Destroy Isis, which was financed in part by a Jordanian construction company, according to disclosures filed with the Senate Office of Public Records. He disclosed payments of $50,000 and stopped lobbying for the group in July.\nIt's unclear why Mueller referred the case. Previously, he referred information about Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen to the U.S. attorney in Manhattan. In July, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said the Justice Department's national security division would take over responsibility of a case filed against a dozen Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking into the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign.\n\"It may have to do with the size of the case, the nature of the case, the resources needed for the case,\" said Mike Koenig, a former Justice Department prosecutor.\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee made a separate criminal referral to the Justice Department based on statements and documents provided by Patten, the committee's chairman, Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, said in a written statement.\n- With assistance by Greg Farrell, Stephanie Baker, Erik Larson, Nick Wadhams, and Bill Allison ", " WASHINGTON (AP) - A business associate of a key figure in the investigation into former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort pleaded guilty Friday to failing to register as a foreign agent.\nW.

W. Samuel Patten entered his plea in federal court in DC, after prosecutors released a charging document that accused him of performing lobbying and consulting work in the US and Ukraine but failing to register as a foreign agent. Patten has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, reports Bloomberg. Patten was a business associate of Konstantin Kilimnik, a man US authorities have said has ties to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik worked closely with Manafort, who was found guilty this month of eight financial counts. Kilimnik also is a co-defendant in a pending case against Manafort, brought by special counsel Robert Mueller's team, that accuses them both of witness tampering. The Patten case was referred by Mueller's team to the United States attorney's office in Washington, which is handling it. Andrew Weissmann, one of the lead Mueller team attorneys in the Manafort prosecution, was seen at court Friday. Court papers don't refer to Kilimnik by name, but say Patten worked with a Russian national on lobbying and political consulting services. Prosecutors say Patten, who formed a consulting company with a person identified only as \"Foreigner A,\" worked to set up meetings with members of Congress and also drafted talking points for Capitol Hill meetings. The goal, prosecutors say, was to influence US policy, but they say Patten never filed under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

The relationships between the woman who died, as well as the badly injured child, to the bride and groom were unclear.\n\"The important thing is to focus on the family, to let them know that this community is behind them, and that we're praying for them,\" Whittier Mayor Joe Vinatieri said.\n  Related Story: 1 killed, child critical after tree topples onto wedding party at Whittier park\n\"It was supposed to be one of the most exciting days of their lives, and instead, it turned into what it turned into,\" he said.\n\"There's so many people in Whittier. ...

The lawsuit, filed last week, demands $175,000 in damages against the university.\nThe university has come under scrutiny in recent years for its handling of sexual assault accusations among students and is being investigated by the federal government for violating Title IX. Now this student says the school has swung too far in the other direction, creating a \"gender-biased, hostile environment against males, like John Doe, based in part on [the University of Chicago's] pattern and practice of investigating and disciplining male students who accept physical contact initiated by female students, retaliating against male students, and providing female students preferential treatment under its Title IX policies.\"\nThe lawsuit, which can be read in full here, details the relationships John Doe had with two unnamed women referred to as Jane Doe and Jane Roe in 2013. The lawsuit claims the relationships and his sexual activities with them were always consensual, but Jane Doe began publicly accusing him of sexual assaulting them in 2016, several years after the fact. The lawsuit excerpts a series of Tumblr blog posts written by one of his accusers in 2013 and 2014 as evidence that the relationship was in fact consensual.\nAmong other issues, the male student says he was harassed by the female students after one Tweeted about the alleged assault and a group of students staged a protest to boycott a student theater production he directed, and after his named was placed on \"the Hyde Park List,\"-a very unofficial list of University of Chicago students accused of sexual misconduct that was disseminated anonymously in 2014.\nThe complaint relies on some common arguments used to refute sexual assault claims women bring against men: that the women are scorned lovers trying to re-write history out of anger, and that people who believe sexual assault allegations are biased against men because of the mainstream cultural image of men as more interested in casual sex than women. The lawsuit claims one female student had a \"vendetta\" against him and was retaliating after being rejected, and that the university operates under \"archaic assumptions that female students do not sexually assault or harass their fellow male students because females are less sexually promiscuous than men.\"\n[H/T Jezebel] ", " A University of Chicago male student from New York accused twice of sexual assault slammed the school's conduct in a new lawsuit, charging that \"UC routinely portrays a large portion of their male students as sexual predators.\"\nThe student, named as John Doe in the lawsuit, claims the university violated Title IX with its unfair treatment. He was subjected to a \"fundamentally unfair, arbitrary and capricious disciplinary procedure that violates both Title IX and UC's policies and/or procedures related to allegations of sexual misconduct,\" according to the lawsuit obtained by the Chicago Maroon, a student newspaper at the school.\nTitle IX is in place to ensure that universities don't discriminate against students and faculty based on gender.\nThe male student, from Somers, N.Y., charges that two women, named as Jane Doe and Jane Roe, falsely accused him of sexual assault. Jane Doe is also being sued, according to the Maroon.\nWhat you should know about reporting sex assault on campus\nThe suit alleges that the school refused to allow John Doe to file a Title IX complaint against Jane Doe for harassment and retaliation, yet UC allowed Jane Doe to file a Title IX complaint to retaliate for an alleged sexual assault two years earlier.\nJohn Doe and Jane Doe became acquainted before their first semester in September 2013 through a Facebook page for accepted students, according to the lawsuit. John Doe and Roe met during their first semester.\nThe lawsuit states that after John Doe broke off his relationships with the two women, Roe filed a complaint with the school falsely accusing John Doe of sexual misconduct in the spring of 2014. The accusation was regarding alleged conduct that took place the previous December.\nThe school rejected Roe's claims \"despite UC's anti-male gender bias conduct and gross negligence in conducting an investigation,\" according to the lawsuit.\nBrown student could be allowed back after sex assault suspension\nHowever, Roe then launched a vendetta against the male student, according to the lawsuit. She placed his name on the so-called \"Hyde Park List,\" a Tumblr page accusing six current and former male students of sexual assault or sexual harassment.\nRoe also \"falsely and maliciously advised members of UC's community that John Doe was a sexual predator,\" according to the suit.\nThe school did not take any steps to \"correct\" Roe's conduct, according to the suit, as John Doe was told the school's \"confidentiality\" policies prevented him from personally refuting Roe's defamation within \"UC's Community.\"\nRoe then blogged in October of 2014 that the school was forcing her to participate in class \"with the person who sexually assaulted [HER].\" The school ordered John Doe removed from the physics lab they were both in, despite his strong opposition, the lawsuit states.\nUC investigating sexually explicit 'gag reflex' sign near campus\nIn addition, the school \"unlawfully alleged a right to discipline\" the male student because his sister responded to Roe's \"fallacious\" posts on Twitter.\nThe other woman mentioned in the suit, Jane Doe, first mentioned in her blog that she had been \"sexually assaulted\" in November of 2014, according to the complaint. However, in her own \"vernacular,\" according to the lawsuit, the male student and Jane Doe \"hooked up\" in September of 2013 but did not have sexual intercourse.\nJane Doe harassed the male student in a series of tweets earlier this year, according to the lawsuit. The male student filed a Title IX complaint against her, but the school took no action.\nThe suit seeks $175,000 in damages, according to the Maroon. ", " A male student twice investigated for sexual assault by the University of Chicago has sued the school, saying its handling of the complaints against him demonstrated a \"gender-based, hostile environment against males.\"\nThe student, identified in the lawsuit as \"John Doe\" from Somers, N.Y., claims the University failed to treat him fairly after a University disciplinary panel cleared him of a sexual assault charge in 2014. The suit also accuses a female student of defamation for publicly saying he assaulted her and others. The complaint was filed on August 24 in federal court in Chicago.\nThe suit asks for more than $175,000 in damages.\nThe case against the University states that, in its treatment of the plaintiff in the case, \"UC was motivated by pro-female, anti-male bias that was, at least in part, adopted to refute criticism within the student body and public press that UC was turning a blind eye to female complaints of sexual assault.\"\nThe suit is part of a recent trend of litigation by male students at American universities who claim to have been discriminated against in sexual assault investigations in violation of Title IX, a federal statute that prohibits sex discrimination at colleges and universities that receive federal funding. So far, these claims have generally failed, though last month a federal appeals court ruled in favor of a similar suit against Columbia University.\nThe suit involves two separate allegations of sexual assault against \"John Doe\" filed with the University as Title IX complaints. The first allegation, filed by a female student called \"Jane Roe\" in the lawsuit, was decided in \"John Doe's\" favor in 2014. The second was filed this year by another female student, called \"Jane Doe\" in the lawsuit, over an alleged instance of sexual assault in 2013. \"Jane Doe\" is being sued, along with the University.\nThe student the suit refers to as \"Jane Roe\" said \"John Doe\" assaulted her in the spring of 2014. A College disciplinary hearing in May of that year \"found that the preponderance of the evidence did not support [\"Jane Roe's\"] allegation that [\"John Doe\"] sexually assaulted her,\" according to a letter sent to the plaintiff by former assistant dean of students Kathleen Ford. The letter was included as an exhibit in the suit.\nThe suit alleges that \"Jane Roe\" told other people at the University of Chicago that \"John Doe\" had raped her and that she added his name to the \"Hyde Park List,\" a Tumblr page that listed students it said had committed sexual assault or harassment.\n\"Roe\" is not a defendant in the lawsuit. Instead, the suit points to the University's decision to remove the plaintiff from a physics lab with \"Roe\" after the case had been decided, and its failure to stop her from repeating her allegations, as examples of the University's bias against him as a male student.\nIn May of this year, the plaintiff directed a TAPS-sponsored play called The Bald Soprano, according to an email released as an exhibit in the case. Before the play's debut, flyers were posted on bulletin boards around campus urging people to boycott the show, and a protest was staged near the theater on the play's opening night.\n\"For me, it's about supporting survivors, boycotting events put on by perpetrators of sexual assault, and accountability in RSOs,\" then second-year Emma Maltby, who participated in the protest, said when interviewed by The Maroon at the time.\nAt the protest, students held signs with slogans like \"Support survivors, not perpetrators,\" \"Boycott rapists,\" \"Silence = violence,\" and \"Hold your friends accountable.\" Some protesters also had tape over their mouths, with \"Support survivors\" written on the tape.\nStudents protest in Reynolds Club. Zoe Kaiser\n\nAt the time, protesters would not speak to The Maroon on the record about whether their protest was related to a specific incident or person.\nBefore the protest, the female student called \"Jane Doe\" in the suit tweeted that the director of a TAPS show had assaulted her and other people on campus. The plaintiff's law firm sent her a cease-and-desist order in June, demanding that she stop saying that \"John Doe\" had sexually assaulted her or other people, formally apologize to him, and issue an apology and retraction on social media. As of publication, the original tweet was still posted on \"Jane Doe's\" Twitter account.\nIn May of this year, \"John Doe\" filed a Title IX complaint against \"Jane Doe,\" alleging harassment. Jeremy Inabinet, associate dean of students for disciplinary affairs, told him that the actions he cited did not constitute harassment under University policy and dismissed the allegation.\n\"Jane Doe\" then filed a Title IX complaint in June against \"John Doe,\" saying he had sexually assaulted her in 2013. \"John Doe\" then filed another complaint with the school, saying that \"Jane Doe's\" complaint was in bad faith and retaliation against his decision to file his May complaint and otherwise defend himself against rape allegations. The University initially told \"John Doe\" that it planned to pursue the case against him under the 2015 Student Manual, which had a different definition of consent from the 2013 Student Manual.\nThe suit says that \"it was impossible for John Doe to know whether his consensual physical encounters with Jane Doe in 2013 might violate subsequently created stringent mandates in UC's 2015 Manual.\"\nThe suit also claims that the University failed to respond to public accusations that \"John Doe\" had sexually assaulted people and treated him unfairly by agreeing to hear \"Jane Doe's\" Title IX complaint. The suit includes selected posts from the female defendant's blog which it alleges show that their 2013 encounter was consensual.\nThe suit alleges that the female defendant's comments were defamatory, and claims that she and the University inflicted emotional distress on the plaintiff. It alleges, among other things, that the University of Chicago violated Title IX by creating a hostile environment, selectively enforcing its provisions, and retaliating against \"John Doe\" for defending himself against allegations of sexual assault.\nThe case states that the University's policy for Title IX investigations takes cues from the Department of Education's \"Dear Colleague\" letter, which lays out how Title IX complaints about sexual violence or harassment between students should be handled by school administrations. It alleges that the letter defines females as the victims in Title IX cases and makes it difficult for male defendants to defend themselves in such investigations.\nAll of the parties in this case declined to comment, either personally or through their legal counsel or press representative.\nAn August 24 docket entry by the clerk of the district court noted that the University of Chicago had agreed to extend the amount of time the plaintiff had to respond to the defendant's Title IX complaint, and to adjudicate that complaint under the definition of consent found in the 2013 Student Manual rather than the definition in the 2015 Student Manual. Judge Edmond Chang ruled that the case will continue to be conducted using pseudonyms for the plaintiff and female defendant, as the plaintiff requested.\nThe next hearing in the case is scheduled for September 14.\nEditor's Note: Based on information available in now-public court documents, it is possible to identify the parties in this lawsuit. The Maroon chose not to identify them because \"John Doe\" is a plaintiff in a defamation lawsuit, and reporting his name might further this alleged defamation, and because \"Jane Doe\" alleges that she is a victim of sexual assault, and The Maroon, like many media organizations, does not report the names of alleged victims of sexual assault without the victim's permission in cases when the victim's name is not widely known."], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1, 37;113, 226", "docSpanText": "A University of Chicago male student<SPAN_SEP>in a new lawsuit, charging that \"UC routinely portrays a large portion of their male students as sexual predators"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "52, 83;229, 274", "docSpanText": "accused twice of sexual assault<SPAN_SEP>The student, named as John Doe in the lawsuit"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "276, 282;343, 449;455, 463;473, 481", "docSpanText": "claims<SPAN_SEP>He was subjected to a \"fundamentally unfair, arbitrary and capricious disciplinary procedure that violates<SPAN_SEP>Title IX<SPAN_SEP>policies"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2049, 2071;2104, 2126;2155, 2181;2208, 2307;2333, 2416", "docSpanText": "She placed his name on<SPAN_SEP>a Tumblr page accusing<SPAN_SEP>students of sexual assault<SPAN_SEP>also \"falsely and maliciously advised members of UC's community that John Doe was a sexual predator<SPAN_SEP>The school did not take any steps to \"correct\" Roe's conduct, according to the suit"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2700, 2774;2807, 2825", "docSpanText": "The school ordered John Doe removed from the physics lab they were both in<SPAN_SEP>the lawsuit states"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "229, 274;884, 911", "docSpanText": "The student, named as John Doe in the lawsuit<SPAN_SEP>Jane Doe is also being sued"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "3560, 3594", "docSpanText": "The suit seeks $175,000 in damages"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "500, 580", "docSpanText": "The lawsuit, filed last week, demands $175,000 in damages against the university"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "582, 698", "docSpanText": "The university has come under scrutiny in recent years for its handling of sexual assault accusations among students"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "775, 910", "docSpanText": "Now this student says the school has swung too far in the other direction, creating a \"gender-biased, hostile environment against males"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1290, 1362;1372, 1535", "docSpanText": "John Doe had with two unnamed women referred to as Jane Doe and Jane Roe<SPAN_SEP>The lawsuit claims the relationships and his sexual activities with them were always consensual, but Jane Doe began publicly accusing him of sexual assaulting them"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "917, 1099", "docSpanText": "John Doe, based in part on [the University of Chicago's] pattern and practice of investigating and disciplining male students who accept physical contact initiated by female students"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1732, 1949", "docSpanText": "Among other issues, the male student says he was harassed by the female students after one Tweeted about the alleged assault and a group of students staged a protest to boycott a student theater production he directed"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "162, 263", "docSpanText": "a male student is suing the Hyde Park school on the grounds that it is not a safe space for young men"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1860, 2139;3877, 4031", "docSpanText": "The student the suit refers to as \"Jane Roe\" said \"John Doe\" assaulted her in the spring of 2014.

Not only is she the person who was in charge of the group that wrongly targeted conservatives, she dishonestly testified that she didn't know about the targeting until 2012, when the inspector general found she knew as early as 2011. She's the person who told a conference call of reporters, \"I'm not that good at math,\" even though she's a manager in an agency that's at bottom all about math.\nWhat I think is even more politically and morally suspect - and has gotten very little attention -- Lerner actually presided over the bizarre, bumbling rollout of the story, by planting a question about the controversy with an attorney at an American Bar Association conference. According to Morgan Lewis tax lawyer Celia Roady, Lerner herself asked that Roady inquire about whether the IRS had targeted conservative groups. That led to Lerner's public apology - and the scandal swirling around the White House, which found itself surprised by the sudden disclosure.\nThe invaluable tax-policy expert David Cay Johnston called for Lerner's firing a week ago - and that was even before there was proof that she had set up the question at the ABA conference. ", " Lois Lerner, the IRS staffer who is under fire for her role in the agency's targeting of conservative groups, has been placed on administrative leave, according to congressional aides.\n\nShe will still be paid while on leave, a congressional aide said, as required under civil service rules.\nLerner, who heads an IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups, first disclosed the extra scrutiny the agency gave to Tea Party groups almost two weeks ago when answering a planted question at a Washington legal conference.\nSince then, lawmakers from across the political spectrum have said that they believe Lerner misled them and have called for her dismissal.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), a senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said in a Thursday statement that new acting IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel had asked Lerner to resign - and that Lerner was only placed on leave after she declined that request. Aides on Capitol Hill confirmed that Lerner had refused to resign.\nIn her first public appearance since the disclosure, Lerner on Wednesday invoked her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination at a House Oversight hearing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe IRS announced in an internal memo circulated to the media that Ken Corbin will be taking over as the acting director of the tax-exempt organizations division. Corbin, a 25-year veteran at the IRS, has been deputy director in a division that processed millions of tax returns a year.\nLerner's move to administrative leave comes after President Obama pushed out acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller over his role in the targeting. Werfel, formerly a senior official at the Office of Management and Budget, took over as acting commissioner on Wednesday.\n\nThe IRS also announced after the controversy broke that Joseph Grant, Lerner's boss at the agency, will retire in early June.\n\nLerner will likely have to make her way back to Capitol Hill in the coming weeks, after House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) concluded that she waved her rights against self-incrimination by defending herself in an opening statement at Wednesday's hearing.\n\nSens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) on Thursday became the latest prominent lawmakers to call for Lerner to be removed, in a letter to Werfel made public shortly before news of Lerner's administrative leave broke.\n\nReps. Sandy Levin (D-Mich.), Joe Crowley (D-N.Y) and Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) have also called for Lerner to be pushed out.\n\"In naming Ken Corbin as acting director to replace Lois Lerner, the administration has taken a strong step to address serious mistakes made by the IRS Exempt Organization Division,\" Levin said in a statement. \"This and further corrective action are vital in restoring the confidence of the American people.\"\n\nAccording to a Treasury audit, Lerner found out in June 2011 that IRS staffers were giving extra scrutiny to conservative groups seeking tax-exempt 501(c)(4) status by searching for organizations with names like \"Tea Party\" and \"patriots.\"\n\nLerner immediately ordered that the criteria targeting conservative groups be changed, but staffers in a Cincinnati office eventually once again implemented more political screening criteria, according to the audit.\n\n\"I have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee,\" Lerner told House Oversight on Wednesday.\n\n\"Because I'm asserting my right not to testify, I know that some people will assume that I've done something wrong. I have not.\"\n\nThe audit, from Treasury's inspector general for tax administration, also found that some groups waited months, even years, for their tax-exempt applications to be approved.\n\nNational Review first reported that Lerner was being placed on administrative leave.\nThe publication also reported late Thursday that letters suggest Lerner was directly involved in the agency's targeting of conservative groups more than nine months after she first learned of the activity.\n- This story was updated at 7:34 p.m. \n"], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "0, 88", "docSpanText": "But Lerner should have been gone shortly after this scandal first unraveled in the press"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "585, 591;628, 763", "docSpanText": "Lerner<SPAN_SEP>bumbling rollout of the story, by planting a question about the controversy with an attorney at an American Bar Association conference."}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "90, 251", "docSpanText": "Not only is she the person who was in charge of the group that wrongly targeted conservatives, she dishonestly testified that she didn't know about the targeting"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "14, 109;111, 150", "docSpanText": "the IRS staffer who is under fire for her role in the agency's targeting of conservative groups<SPAN_SEP>has been placed on administrative leave"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "292, 357;365, 429", "docSpanText": "Lerner, who heads an IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups<SPAN_SEP>disclosed the extra scrutiny the agency gave to Tea Party groups"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "456, 517;531, 656", "docSpanText": "answering a planted question at a Washington legal conference<SPAN_SEP>lawmakers from across the political spectrum have said that they believe Lerner misled them and have called for her dismissal"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1994, 2086", "docSpanText": "she waved her rights against self-incrimination by defending herself in an opening statement"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "767, 807", "docSpanText": "new acting IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel"}], "summary": "The IRS official at the center of the recent scandal has been placed on administrative leave, reports the National Review.

Kaepernick has not played since the 2016 season and his contract has not been picked up by another team, largely due to the controversy. Reports emerged last year that Jay-Z had turned down an offer to perform during halftime, which he seemingly confirmed in the lyrics to his recent song with Beyonce, \"Apesh-\": \"I said no to the Super Bowl: you need me, I don't need you.\"\nReached for comment, a NFL rep tells Variety, \"It's a Super Bowl tradition to speculate about the performers for the Pepsi Halftime Show.

The data comes from Census' 2014 survey on families.\n\"The rate of children living with married parents who receive food stamps has doubled since 2007,\" Census said.\nThe findings are likely to bolster claims from some Republicans that the Obama administration seems to have a goal of putting more people under government aid programs. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in 2012 called President Barack Obama the \"food stamp president,\" which led some to say his comment was racist.\nThe debate over food stamps has led to a sort of chicken-and-egg argument between Republicans and Democrats. The GOP has said the end of the recession should allow Congress to reduce spending on food stamps.\nWhile Democrats have tried to give President Barack Obama credit for a rebounding economy, they also note that millions of additional people are using food stamps, and that the program should not be cut yet. The total number of people using food stamps has almost doubled since the start of the Great Recession, to nearly 48 million in 2013.\nThe number finally dipped from that peak in 2014, but just a little, to about 46 million people.\nRepublicans have tried since 2013 to cut food stamp spending, as part of their overall plan to slow spending and get control of the budget deficit. In 2013, the House voted to cut $39 billion from food stamps over a decade, and almost a year ago, President Barack Obama signed a final deal that will cut just $8.7 billion from the program over ten years.\nThat cut was estimated to reduce food stamp benefits by about $90 per month for the hundreds of thousands of homes that use them.

The final farm bill signed into law trimmed $8.6 billion from the program, eliminating benefits for about 850,000 people, according to estimates by anti-hunger advocates.\nOther findings of the survey show a rapidly changing America in which more children are being raised in single-parent homes and more young people are delaying marriage.\nOf the 73.7 million children under 18 in the United States, 27 percent were living in single parent homes last year, tripling the 9 percent in 1960.\nThe number of marriages also dwindled last year with less than half of households in America made up of married couples, compared to three-quarters in 1940, the survey found.\nThe median age for people first getting married in 2014 was 29 for men and 27 for women up from 24 and 21 respectively in 1947.\n(Reporting by Elvina Nawaguna; Editing by Sandra Maler) ", " The number of children receiving food stamps remains higher than it was before the start of the Great Recession in 2007, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's annual Families and Living Arrangements table package released today.\n\nThe rate of children living with married parents who receive food stamps has doubled since 2007.

The runoffs have also removed gold out of the old abandoned mines and sent it down the river.\n\"It's going to bring down more gold,\" said Thomas. \"It's going to bring up new areas that I never got to.\"\nThomas runs tour groups through his property and said now is the optimum time for gold hunting because the storms have just finished churning the landscape.\nOfficials from the Bureau of Land Management say the erosion \"concentrates\" the gold by removing the lighter rock and soil.\nYou may be wondering if this reporter found any during our time here. We did find some fine flakes of what they call \"flour gold\" and it was found more quickly than normal in just a couple of panning sessions.\n\"Eureka!\" said Thomas.\"That's hard to do.\"\nBut not as hard this year, now that Mother Nature has shaken up the motherlode.\nThomas said one hot spot this year will be below the Oroville Dam, because the huge water releases from the spillway could reveal some new pockets of gold. ", " Joey Wilson, left, rings up Curtis Barwick for a gold pan and a portable slough Saturday at Adventures in Prospecting in downtown Oroville. Dan Reidel - Enterprise-Record\nOroville >> Now is not the time to quit your day job in hopes of striking it rich. However, people with a new or renewed interest in gold mining may be spending more of their summer weekends near rivers and streams.\nJoey Wilson owns Adventures in Prospecting in Oroville, where he says there's been more excitement among his gold mining customers.\n\"There's always been gold in the Feather River,\" he said. What's new is that the recent floods have moved things around.\nIt's not just the Feather River. Floods scoured the banks of the American River, the Mokelumne, the Yuba and just about any other waterway where 49ers once got their boots dirty.\nCurtis Barwick was in Oroville Saturday waiting for the prospecting store to open. He usually looks for gold closer to his home in Anderson, but decided to check out Oroville on his day off. He said gold mining gets him outdoors and helps him \"recharge,\" after a stressful week at work. It's a lot like hiking, another of his hobbies, but with gold mining there's a chance of a reward.\n\"The odds are greater than winning the lottery,\" he said. Even on days when he only finds a few flakes, it's fun to turn over rocks and sand.\nHe's not alone. In fact, he's a member of the Shasta Miners and Prospectors Association.\nBack in the day, miners in the 1850s did not have metal detectors. Barwick bought one a while back and said if \"lead was gold, I'd be rich.\" He had found more bullet casings than he cares to collect. Other finds include coins, and a 1944 nickel. He gave his girlfriend a ring he found in the dirt, and would recommend that anyone who buys a metal detector have some fun digging around in their own backyard.\nOthers make gold mining an adventure. That's one of the reasons Wilson named his shop \"Adventures in Prospecting.\" He sells wet suits and fins, and personally loves to dive when he hunts gold.\nFinding gold is a common thread for Cindy and Paul Pekarek, who were at the Montgomery Street miner's supply shop Saturday. The couple belong to the Mother Lode Goldhounds, near Grass Valley, and for fun they travel to new digs, including Oroville.\nPaul Pekarek is a five-time gold mining champion, he said pointing to a pin on his wide-brimmed, black leather hat. The pin includes a miniature gold pan, pickaxe and shovel, with a real glob of gold in the center. To win the championships, he proved he could pan faster than most others.\nAdvertisement\nSome people, like Mark Saposnik, are \"pretty serious\" about gold mining. Saposnik spent his summers during college dredge mining. It's more difficult to find gold now that dredging is no longer allowed, he said. The recent floods have \"rearranged the rivers,\" he said, and he'll spend more time stomping around.\nSpillway gold?\nGold miners can speculate all they want about gold that may or may not have washed down the hillside near the Oroville spillway. Before hydraulic mining was outlawed, hillsides up and down the river were washed away to unearth gold.\nGold is heavy, and prospectors would love to discover what is among the debris at the Diversion Pool. However, the area is closed except for the work crew.\nRecent word from Department of Water Resources acting director Bill Croyle was that he did not know if gold had been found in the area.\nIt's a moot point because \"if anybody gets close to it they will be run off,\" said Bob Van Camp, known locally as \"Digger Bob.\"\nVan Camp was the spokesman in 2014 when a 5.18 pound gold nugget was found in the Butte foothills. The man who found the nugget has remained anonymous, but Van Camp was allowed to tell the story.\nAs for the spillway debris, Van Camp said he believes there is a gold vein that runs from Potter's Ravine and south, including the area of the spillway.\nIn addition to panning near waterways, prospectors look for quartz, especially chunks that have been worn smooth by water flow. \"Then you go downstream.\"\nHe'll also walk the higher ground with a metal detector, hoping some of that quartz will give him a strong signal.\nNinety-nine percent of the time the quartz is just quartz, but \"now and again,\" the quartz will have \"some sort of metal in it.\" This might mean manganese or silver, \"or there may be gold inside.\"\nPart of the fun in finding gold is knowing it's something that an old-time gold miner missed, Van Camp said. \"I don't do it for the money. I just do it for the adventure, for the challenge.\"\nHe would love to get his hands dirty in the Diversion Pool at Lake Oroville right now. However, he understands that DWR is working night and day to get the water flow back to normal.\nPeople will be looking at other areas, where gold panning is allowed. After the floods of the mid 1990s, \"it was good getting for those of us who knew how to look,\" he said.\nFor an amateur, the adventure could lead to frustration. \"But I don't want to discourage people from learning about history, getting some fresh air and enjoying themselves, even if they don't find anything.\"\nRight now, the water is still high. When dry times arrive, more streambed will be exposed, he said.\n\"I'm going to have a ball this summer.\"\nKnow the rules\nThe rules have changed for gold miners.

While KCRA reports that gold can simply be picked off the ground following major flooding, the best prospecting will come in the summer months when the water has receded. Right now, rivers are still high and government workers are trying to keep would-be prospectors away while they get things under control. But in the summer-which experts say could be the busiest since the one that followed major flooding in 1997-stream beds will be exposed for better gold hunting. \"I'm going to have a ball,\" one prospector tells the Chico newspaper. The epicenter for the new gold rush could be the Oroville Dam, which nearly catastrophically flooded this winter and required the use of an emergency spillway for the first time.

The Raleigh News & Observer says that Deena Murphy and Timothy Sullivan agreed to participate in the hit HGTV series under the guise that they were considering a move to a rental property with their teenage foster children. The problem, according to the suit against Big Coat TV and Aaron Fitz Construction, was that the show's principals-designer Hilary Farr, real estate agent David Visentin, and contractor Eric Eremita-are \"actors or television personalities playing a role for the camera,\" not people who \"played more than a casual role in the actual renovation process.\" While this shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who's ever suffered through Farr and Visentin's bullshit \"no, you are\" banter, it's still mildly disheartening to hear.\nFor the episode, which aired in April 2015, Murphy and Sullivan were asked to deposit $140,000 into a fund with the production company, who would later use that money to pay Fitz and other subcontractors. According to the suit, the couple voiced its concerns about Fitz, saying it had below-average reviews on Angie's List, but they were ignored. Over the course of the renovations, only $85,780.50 was disbursed to Fitz, leaving the couple wondering where the rest of their money went. The suit also questions how Big Coat can operate as a general contractor, a role it's not licensed for.\nMurphy and Sullivan are also claiming that Love It Or List It is even more of a scam than it generally seems, with the couple saying the show never used a licensed architect to develop plans for their house, and that they were never shown houses that were actually for sale in North Carolina-or for sale by any licensed North Carolina real estate broker. They also say any work done on the show was work that they'd previously made plans for with another company, Werx-Design Build.\nAccording to the suit, the actual work done on the house was \"disastrous,\" leaving the home \"irreparably damaged.\" Duct work was left open, leading to vermin entering the house, and the couple complains of \"low-grade industrial carpeting, unpainted surfaces, and windows painted shut.\"\nAs the News & Observer summarizes, \"Big Coat's purported agreement,\" the lawsuit contends, 'admits that it is in the business of television production, not construction. ...

I am not a regular viewer so I can't say if the man on the right is an extra or an actual character.\nThis picture has itself caused scandal in the UK, as it was a gay kiss that was broadcast before the watershed, and as such led to a number of complaints to the BBC. However, since this episode aired (October 2008) Christian now has a boyfriend and a few more gay kisses have taken place.\nIn relation to the John Snow Kiss-In event, I used this particular photo because I considered it to be quite mild (no groping, no tongues). The photos I had considered using before I chose that one are much more racy. Oh the irony!\nSecondly, the removal of the Facebook John Snow Kiss-In event:\nIt turns out that the Facebook event for the John Snow Kiss-In was not blocked by Facebook, but made private by the creator of the event itself. Paul Shetler, the organizer, left this comment on the previous thread:\n\"Hey I just saw this. Before it goes too far, I just want people to know that FB have NOT removed the kiss-in event page; it's still there, but _I made the event private after the event_ was over and only visible to those who had been invited as there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it.\"\nThanks for clearing that up, Paul. Now if Facebook will only reply to Richard's query about why they removed my original post and photo when he put it up on his wall...\nIt has been erroneously reported in the media that our own Richard Metzger (who lives in Los Angeles) organized the London \"Kiss-In\" event, which is untrue, and also unfair to Paul Shetler and the actual organizers.

They then built a shrine and a church around that site.\nThree different Christian denominations - Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox - share custody over the church, and there have been turf wars and brawls in the past over the management of the site.\nEven the restoration took decades to settle. In 1959, the various denominations agreed to conserve the edicule, but it took until 2016 to actually agree on a plan for the restoration, National Geographic archaeologist-in-residence Fredrik Hiebert said.\nThe same Greek team that restored the Acropolis in Athens was chosen to carry out the project.\nArchaeologists believe there may be more surprises to come at the site.\n\"There is so much information in the data that was collected by the restorers during the conservation project,\" Hiebert said. \"There are many, many stories still to be told.\" ", " Over the centuries, Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre has suffered violent attacks, fires, and earthquakes. It was totally destroyed in 1009 and subsequently rebuilt, leading modern scholars to question whether it could possibly be the site identified as the burial place of Christ by a delegation sent from Rome some 17 centuries ago.\nNow the results of scientific tests provided to National Geographic appear to confirm that the remains of a limestone cave enshrined within the church are remnants of the tomb located by the ancient Romans.\nMortar sampled from between the original limestone surface of the tomb and a marble slab that covers it has been dated to around A.D. 345. According to historical accounts, the tomb was discovered by the Romans and enshrined around 326.\nView Images A restorer removes debris beneath a broken marble slab to expose the original rock surface of what is considered the burial place of Jesus. Photograph by Oded Balilty, AP for National Geographic\nUntil now, the earliest architectural evidence found in and around the tomb complex dated to the Crusader period, making it no older than 1,000 years.\nWhile it is archaeologically impossible to say that the tomb is the burial site of an individual Jew known as Jesus of Nazareth, who according to New Testament accounts was crucified in Jerusalem in 30 or 33, new dating results put the original construction of today's tomb complex securely in the time of Constantine, Rome's first Christian emperor.\nThe tomb was opened for the first time in centuries in October 2016, when the shrine that encloses the tomb, known as the Edicule, underwent a significant restoration by an interdisciplinary team from the National Technical University of Athens.\nSeveral samples of mortar from different locations within the Edicule were taken at that time for dating, and the results were recently provided to National Geographic by Chief Scientific Supervisor Antonia Moropoulou, who directed the Edicule restoration project.\nWhen Constantine's representatives arrived in Jerusalem around 325 to locate the tomb, they were allegedly pointed to a Roman temple built some 200 years earlier. The Roman temple was razed and excavations beneath it revealed a tomb hewn from a limestone cave. The top of the cave was sheared off to expose the interior of the tomb, and the Edicule was built around it.\nA feature of the tomb is a long shelf, or \"burial bed,\" which according to tradition was where the body of Jesus Christ was laid out following crucifixion. Such shelves and niches, hewn from limestone caves, are a common feature in tombs of wealthy 1st-century Jerusalem Jews.\nThe marble cladding that covers the \"burial bed\" is believed to have been installed in 1555 at the latest, and most likely was present since the mid-1300s, according to pilgrim accounts.\nWhen the tomb was opened on the night of October 26, 2016, scientists were surprised by what they found beneath the marble cladding: an older, broken marble slab incised with a cross, resting directly atop the original limestone surface of the \"burial bed.\"\nSome researchers speculated that this older slab may have been laid down in the Crusader period, while others offered an earlier date, suggesting that it may have already been in place and broken when the church was destroyed in 1009. No one, however, was ready to claim that this might be the first physical evidence for the earliest Roman shrine on the site.\nIs This Really The Tomb Of Christ? Scholars discuss whether the tomb of Christ is actually the tomb of Christ and how it would have looked.\nThe new test results, which reveal the lower slab was most likely mortared in place in the mid-fourth century under the orders of Emperor Constantine, come as a welcome surprise to those who study the history of the sacred monument.\n\"Obviously that date is spot-on for whatever Constantine did,\" says archaeologist Martin Biddle, who published a seminal study on the history of the tomb in 1999. \"That's very remarkable.\"\nDuring their year-long restoration of the Edicule, the scientists were also able to determine that a significant amount of the burial cave remains enclosed within the walls of the shrine. Mortar samples taken from remains of the southern wall of the cave were dated to 335 and 1570, which provide additional evidence for construction works from the Roman period, as well as a documented 16th-century restoration. Mortar taken from the tomb entrance has been dated to the 11th century and is consistent with the reconstruction of the Edicule following its destruction in 1009.\n\"It is interesting how [these] mortars not only provide evidence for the earliest shrine on the site, but also confirm the historical construction sequence of the Edicule,\" Moropoulou observes.\nThe mortar samples were independently dated at two separate labs using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), a technique that determines when quartz sediment was most recently exposed to light. The scientific results will be published by Moropoulou and her team in a forthcoming issue of the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports.\nSecrets of Christ's Tomb premieres Sunday December 3 at 9/8c on the National Geographic Channel.

It's easiest to understand the significance by understanding the history: Around AD 325, experts believe Roman Emperor Constantine the Great arrived in Jerusalem on the hunt for places linked to Jesus; his team identified the cave that they believed Jesus was buried in and built a shrine (known as the Edicule) to enclose the tomb and then a church around it. That church was destroyed in 1009, recounts National Geographic. It was rebuilt, and all archaeological dating coincided with that rebuilding-proving it was at most about 1,000 years old. The tomb was opened for the first time in centuries in October 2016 to allow for the Edicule to be restored. A marble slab was discovered beneath marble cladding, and mortar samples taken from the slab dated to around AD 345. National Geographic's take: \"While it is archaeologically impossible to say that the tomb is the burial site of an individual Jew known as Jesus of Nazareth ... [the] results put the original construction of today's tomb complex securely in the time of Constantine.\" (Scientists have issued a dire warning about the site.)"}, "test14": {"documents": ["WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) - A volcanic eruption in Tonga has created a new island - although one scientist said Wednesday it could soon disappear.\nCORRECTS SOURCE - In this photo, taken Jan. 14, 2015 and released by New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, a volcano erupts near Tonga in the South Pacific Ocean.

(AP) - Authorities on Wednesday were searching for an inmate they believe has made his second escape from a maximum-security South Carolina prison.\nOfficers began searching just before 2 p.m. Wednesday for Jimmy Causey, an inmate at Lieber Correctional Institution, about 90 miles (149 km) southeast of Columbia, according to Sommer Sharpe, spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections. No other details have been released.\nCausey, 46, has now escaped from two different prisons in a dozen years. He and another inmate, convicted murderer Johnny Brewer, escaped Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia in 2005 by hiding in a trash truck.\nThe pair eluded authorities for three days before being apprehended at a motel along busy Interstate 95, not far from the prison from which Causey escaped on Wednesday. A pizza delivery driver told The Associated Press at the time she tipped off authorities when she recognized a customer as one of the two men being sought by authorities.\nBoth men were returned to prison. Brewer was found two years later, hanging from a bed sheet in his cell. Grilled by state lawmakers about how the escape happened, then-prisons director Jon Ozmint blamed budget cutbacks that had forced his department to cut 800 security positions, leaving some areas like the trash compactor and loading dock unmonitored by officers.\nThe director also said the men had fashioned fake heads out of toilet paper and put them in their beds, fooling officers at a 7:15 a.m. prisoner count. After a 9:00 a.m. count came up short, officials did a roll call and realized the two were missing.\nCausey, 46, was sentenced to life in prison in 2004 after he was convicted of holding Columbia attorney Jack Swerling and his family at gunpoint in their home. He was first incarcerated in state prison in 1992 on charges including grand larceny, according to online records.\nIn December, another inmate serving a life sentence escaped from a different maximum-security prison in South Carolina. Authorities said 47-year-old Michael Allen Williamson stabbed a police officer during his escape from McCormick Correctional Institution in the western part of the state. The officer's protective vest deflected many blows, but she was treated for two stab wounds to her arm and shoulder.\n___\nKinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP.

I'm sitting in the passenger seat of a camo-painted ATV, rumbling through the northern Louisiana backwoods with Phil Robertson, founder of the Duck Commander company, patriarch at the heart of A&E's smash reality hit Duck Dynasty, and my tour guide for the afternoon. There are seat belts in this ATV, but it doesn't look like they've ever been used. Phil is not wearing one. I am not wearing one, because I don't want Phil to think I'm a pussy. (Too late!) The crossbow-a Barnett model equipped with a steel-tipped four-blade broadhead arrow-is perched on the dash between us. It looks like you could shoot through a goddamn mountain with it.\n\"That'll bury up in you and kill you dead,\" Phil says.\nThe bow is cocked and loaded, just in case a deer stumbles in front of us and we need to do a redneck drive-by on the poor bastard, but the safety is on. SAFETY FIRST. Still, Phil warns me, \"You don't want to be bumping that.\"\nAs we drive out into the woods, past a sign that reads parish maintenance ends, Phil is telling me all about the land around us and how the animals are a glorious gift from God and how blowing their heads off is part of His plan for us.\n\"Look at this,\" he says, gesturing to the surrounding wilderness. \"The Almighty gave us this. Genesis 9 is where the animals went wild, and God gave them wildness. After the flood, that's when he made animals wild. Up until that time, everybody was vegetarian. After the flood, he said, 'I'm giving you everything now. Animals are wild.'\"\nThere's a fly parked on Phil's long beard. It's been there the whole ride, and I desperately want to pluck it out, but I decide against it. Along with the crossbow, there's a loaded .22-caliber rifle rattling around in the footwell. And yet, much like the 14 million Americans who Nielsen says tune in to Duck Dynasty every week-over 2 million more than the audience for the Breaking Bad finale-I am comfortable here in these woods with Phil and his small cache of deadly weaponry. He is welcoming and gracious. He is a man who preaches the gospel of the outdoors and, to my great envy, practices what he preaches. He spends most of his time out here, daydreaming about what he calls a \"pristine earth\": a world where nothing gets in the way of nature or the hunters who lovingly maintain it. No cities. No buildings. No highways.\nOh, and no sinners, too. So here's where things get a bit uncomfortable. Phil calls himself a Bible-thumper, and holy shit, he thumps that Bible hard enough to ring the bell at a county-fair test of strength. If you watch Duck Dynasty, you can hear plenty of it in the nondenominational supper-table prayer the family recites at the end of every episode, and in the show's no-cussing, no-blaspheming tone. But there are more things Phil would like to say-\"controversial\" things, as he puts it to me-that don't make the cut. (This March, for instance, he told the Christian-oriented Sports Spectrum magazine that he didn't approve of A&E editing out \"in Jesus\" from a family prayer scene, even though A&E says that the phrase has been uttered in at least seventeen episodes.)\nOut here in these woods, without any cameras around, Phil is free to say what he wants. Maybe a little too free. He's got lots of thoughts on modern immorality, and there's no stopping them from rushing out. Like this one:\n\"It seems like, to me, a vagina-as a man-would be more desirable than a man's anus. That's just me. I'm just thinking: There's more there! She's got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I'm saying? But hey, sin: It's not logical, my man. It's just not logical.\"\nPerhaps we'll be needing that seat belt after all.\n  \nThe Duck Dynasty origin story is the mighty river from which all other Robertson-family stories flow. And it is an awesome story, one that improves the more it is told, so here is my stab at it: Phil Robertson grew up bone poor in the northwest corner of this state-a place where Cajun redneck culture and Ozark redneck culture intersect-to a manic-depressive mother and a roughneck father. He was a star quarterback in high school and earned a scholarship to play at Louisiana Tech, but quit after one season because football interfered with duck-hunting season. The guy who took his roster spot at Tech was Terry Bradshaw, because that's how these kinds of stories go.\nPhil On Growing Up in Pre-Civil-Rights-Era Louisiana\n\"I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I'm with the blacks, because we're white trash. We're going across the field.... They're singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, 'I tell you what: These doggone white people'-not a word!... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.\"\nAccording to Phil's autobiography-a ghostwritten book he says he has never read-he spent his days after Tech doing odd jobs and his evenings getting drunk, chasing tail, and swallowing diet pills and black mollies, a form of medicinal speed. In his midtwenties, already married with three sons, a piss-drunk Robertson kicked his family out of the house. \"I'm sick of you,\" he told his wife, Kay. But Robertson soon realized the error of his ways, begged Kay to come back, and turned over his life to Jesus Christ.\nIn 1972, with Jesus at the wheel, Robertson founded the Duck Commander company, which sold a line of custom-made duck-hunting calls that quickly became popular among avid hunters for their uncanny accuracy in replicating the sound of a real duck. He eventually sold half the company to his son Willie, now 41, and together they made a DVD series about the family's duck hunts, which led to a show on the Outdoor Channel, which led to Duck Dynasty on A&E, which led to everything blowing right the fuck up.\nThe show-a reality sitcom showcasing the semiscripted high jinks of Phil, his brother \"Uncle Si,\" his four sons, Alan, Willie, Jase, and Jep, and the perpetually exasperated but always perfectly accessorized Robertson-family ladies-has become the biggest reality-TV hit in the history of cable television, reportedly earning the family a holy shit-worthy $200,000-an-episode paycheck. It's a funny, family-friendly show, with \"skits that we come up with,\" as Phil describes the writing process. They plunder beehives. They blow up beaver dams. And when the Robertson-family ladies go up to a rooftop in a hydraulic lift, you just know that lift will \"accidentally\" get stuck and strand them.\nBut the show, whose fifth season premieres on January 15, is just one part of the family's pop-cultural dominance. In 2013 four books written (kind of!) by Robertson family members made the top ten on the New York Times nonfiction best-seller list. Another book-penned by Jase Robertson and detailing his Christian rebirth at age 14, his struggle to forgive his father's past behavior, and his young daughter's struggle through five facial-reconstruction surgeries to overcome a severe cleft lip and palate-is forthcoming and destined to make it five best-sellers. There's also a book of devotionals somewhere in there, along with Duck Dynasty-themed birthday cards, bobblehead dolls, camo apparel (pink camo for the ladies), Cajun-spice seasoning, car fresheners, iPhone games (from the press release: \"As players successfully complete the challenges, their beards grow to epic proportions and they start to transform from a yuppie into a full-blown redneck!\"), and presumably some sort of camou flage home-pregnancy test.\nIt's easy to see the appeal. The Robertsons are immensely likable. They're funny. They look cool. They're \"smarter than they look,\" says sportswriter Mark Schlabach, who co-writes the family's books. And they are remarkably honest both with one another and with the viewing audience: Phil's old hell-raising, Si's traumatic stint in Vietnam, the intervention that the family staged for Jep when he was boozing and doing drugs in college (Phil placed him under house arrest for three months)-all of it is out in the open. The more they reveal, the more people feel connected to them.\nAnd then, of course, there is their faith, which plays no small role here. During the family's initial negotiations about the show with A&E, Jase told me, \"the three no-compromises were faith, betrayal of family members, and duck season.\" That refusal to betray their faith or one another has been a staple of every media article about the Robertson family. It's their elevator pitch, and it has made them into ideal Christian icons: beloved for staking out a bit of holy ground within the mostly secular, often downright sinful, pop culture of America.\n  \nPhil Robertson's house is located in the sticks about twenty miles outside the city of Monroe (pronounce it mun-roe). It's a rather small house-the kind of place its owner would proudly call \"humble.\" The kitchen table is covered with big plastic tubs of cinnamon rolls and mini muffins. There are candy dishes filled to the brim, bricks of softening butter, and packages of jerky made from unknown animals, sent by unnamed fans. (I tried some, and it was awesome.) Just inside the front door, a giant flat-screen TV shows Fox News on mute at all times, and a bunch of big squishy sofas are arranged in a rectangle around it.\nSi Robertson is sitting on the couch facing the TV. Jep Robertson, age 35, the youngest son, curls up in a recliner in the corner with a pistol strapped to his waist. He barely speaks, like a countrified Silent Bob. Jase, 44, and Willie share a love seat while Phil lounges barefoot on a camo-patterned recliner in the far corner of the room. Two dogs share the recliner's footrest with Phil's heavily callused bare feet. He has severe bunions, so his big toes jut in at forty-five-degree angles. The main TV room is cluttered with mismatched furniture and photos hung haphazardly on the walls. And Phil looks like part of the clutter himself, as if he'd been wedged into that recliner a while back by some absentminded homeowner who didn't know where else to put him.

It intercepted more than 80 percent of the targets it engaged in March when nearly 300 rockets and mortars were fired at southern Israel, the Pentagon said at the time.\nThe drone was first spotted above the Mediterranean near the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip to the west of Israel, said military spokeswoman Avital Leibovich. An Israeli warplane shot it down above a forest near the occupied West Bank.\nIsraeli parliament member Miri Regev, a former chief spokesman of the military, wrote on Twitter it was an \"Iranian drone launched by Hezbollah\", referring to the Lebanese Shi'ite group that fought a war with Israel in 2006.\nIsraeli defense officials have not confirmed this.\nAberoumand attributed claims the drone was made by Iran to a \"psychological operation\" by Israel, but did not confirm or deny them. \"The Zionist regime (Israel) has many enemies,\" he added.\nOn at least one occasion, Iranian-backed Hezbollah has sent a drone into Israeli airspace.

Hospital sources in Gaza said Makawi died of his wounds.\nThe armed wing of Hamas, the Islamists who control the Gaza Strip, said it had joined in Monday's rocket attack along with the smaller Islamic Jihad group.\nGaza has been under the control of Hamas since 2007. The Islamist group rejects permanent peace with Israel and the two sides fought a three-week war in December-January 2008-2009. The border is tense, with frequent clashes.\nThe Israeli army says over 470 rockets have been fired from Gaza this year, but it was the first time since June that Hamas had acknowledged launching rockets at Israel. A Hamas spokesman said the movement would not remain passive in the face of what it called \"one-sided\" Israeli violence.\nThe Israeli army said it had targeted \"Hamas terror activity sites and terrorist squads responsible for the rocket fire\", but gave no details. Israeli forces say they will not tolerate such attacks and will hold Hamas responsible for them.\nGaza hospital officials said one Islamic Jihad militant thought to have been involved in the rocket attack had been wounded by Israeli tank fire east of the town of Rafah.\nResidents of Khan Younis in southern Gaza said an Israeli tank fired at the suspected launch area, slightly wounding four children and damaging a minaret and a water tower.\nAbu Ubaida, spokesman of the Hamas armed wing Izz El-Deen Al-Qassam Brigades, said the rocket firing was a message to Israel that it would not accept \"a formula of a one-sided aggression by the occupation on flimsy pretexts\".\nWith Egyptian mediation, Hamas has made efforts in the past to clamp down on smaller militant groups that persist in mounting attacks on Israel, partly in order to avoid another devastating war. The Israeli offensive in the winter of 2009 killed more than 1,000 Palestinians.\nBut on Monday Abu Ubaida said Hamas had displayed a \"high level of coordination\" with Islamic Jihad in unleashing the latest rocket barrage.\n\"Should the enemy continue its aggression against the Gaza Strip the reaction by the resistance will be stronger and broader,\" he said.\nThe homemade weapons fired from Gaza are inaccurate, but potentially lethal.

", " Summary: Microsoft's acquisition of Nokia is aimed at building a devices and services strategy, but the joint company won't take the same form as Apple.\nMicrosoft has been working on its evolution into a devices and services company, away from the services business it has traditionally been, for several years now with limited success.\nIts acquisition of most of Nokia is the latest acceleration of that strategy - to move further away from the moribund world of the beige desktop and towards the sunlit world of smartphones and tablets.\nOwning the desktop (via Windows) and building additional services on top, like Office or search, has been vital for Microsoft's strategy until now, so as our interest shifts from the desktop to the tablet or smartphone it's essential to Microsoft's broader business (even Azure) that it can retain that connection in some form. To be a winner in the business market it also has to be a winner in the consumer market, something that wasn't the case a decade ago.\nAs Microsoft's own presentation about the deal, announced on Monday, notes: \"With the consumerisation of IT user matter at both home and work... We cannot risk having Apple or Google foreclose app innovation, integration, distribution or economics.\"\nNokia lashed itself to Microsoft's mast after losing out to iOS and Android in the smartphone market share stakes and with the limited success of the Lumia range so far enough to keep interest in Windows Phone alive, most analysts are seeing a certain amount of inevitability to the acquisition, even if they are split on what its biggest implications are.\nForrester mobile analyst Charles Golvin said the steadily diminishing investments by other Windows Phone licensees has left Microsoft with just Nokia as its standard bearer and added Microsoft now appears \"poised to adopt a vertically integrated strategy more akin to Apple's\".\nBut he said Microsoft's challenge remains how to unite the myriad services and brands - Windows, Nokia, Live, Surface, Xbox, Bing and more - into a cohesive experience that will command and cement customer loyalty.\n\"That's a tall order and one that should weigh strongly on the board's choice of a new CEO,\" he said.\nRichard Holway, chairman of analyst TechMarketView, said given that Microsoft paid $8.5bn for Skype in 2011, the price it is paying for Nokia \"seems extremely reasonable\".\nHowever, he added: \"Our only 'surprise' now is the timing of the announcement. For such a big deal to come just days after Ballmer stood down seems mighty strange.\"\nFor Holway, there is also an opportunity for the enlarged Microsoft to step up its business mobility efforts: \"There is undoubtedly a market opportunity for the creation of a provider of mobile solutions for the enterprise. Taking Office onto various mobile platforms. Providing secure emailing in a sector once occupied by BlackBerry.\"\nBut such a move carries its own risks - Microsoft's success has been build on being hardware agnostic and persuading device manufacturers to support it. Already its move into the tablet market with Surface will have unsettled its manufacturers which have struggled to come up with convincing form factors to tackle the decline of the PC. If Nokia's rumoured tablet appears too, this will further complicate Microsoft's relations with these partners who are essential for the success of Windows 8 (as well as Office and other products).\nBut, as Holway points out, \"on balance, Microsoft needed to make a bold move into mobile. Not doing so would mean certain terminal decline. This way at least holds out some chance of survival.\"\nCarolina Milanesi, research vice president at analyst Gartner, said by buying rather than just partnering with Nokia, Microsoft gets deeper integration, the benefit of its patents and removes any risk of Nokia either going Android or being acquired by someone else.\nBut success against iOS and Android will depend on how the companies integrate.\n\"Nokia benefits from higher R&D spend as well as more marketing budget. Microsoft benefits from a good relationship with carriers, good direct channel presence in emerging markets, the potential of going after more aggressively to the business market,\" she told ZDNet.\nBut for Milanesi, business is a secondary concern, even if it is an attractive target where Microsoft, and to a less extent Nokia, have experience: \"First and foremost it needs to be about consumers. Enterprise are certainly a target especially considering the state BlackBerry is in but consumers make or break a phone vendor today.\"\nFrom Milanesi's point of view, emerging markets need to be a longer term target for Microsoft - but the battle needs to be won in the mature markets first.\nFor Forrester principal analyst Thomas Husson, Nokia adds to Microsoft's developing market strategy. It's looking increasingly likely that the US and western European smartphone market is reaching saturation, so that most growth will come from emerging markets. Here Nokia's Asha devices could play a neat role as an 'on-ramp' for consumers buying their first smartphone. Tied in with a revamped tablet strategy this could open up a new front against Android in particular.\nBut Husson cautioned: \"This is going to be a long journey. In some countries, Windows Phone 8 market share is now above five percent and close to 10 percent. It thus still offers a limited reach for developers and marketers.\n\"Nokia is indeed still massivley popular in some emerging countries but competition is very high with Far East manufacturers and low-cost Android devices. I think it will depend on Microsoft's new strategy for emerging markets beyond just mobile phones.\"\nAll of this shows the number of competing - and occasionally contradictory - demands upon Microsoft's management.\nAs the incumbent player in a fading market, Microsoft has a take into account those differing requirements as it tries to build for the future. For example, balancing Microsoft's business customers against the need to get into consumer tech, the need to build its own hardware business against the need to keep manufacturers onside, and building up a mobile business while protecting its PC heritage.\nIt's easy to look at Apple's integrated hardware and software model and the rich ecosystem that sits around it, but it's much harder to emulate.\nGlobal coverage: Nokia Interim CEO: Microsoft deal makes us stronger | Even with Nokia devices, Microsoft wants to license Windows Phone to other makers | Does its Nokia buy thwart or fuel a possible Microsoft break-up? | Microsoft shows how to flush decades of Nokia goodwill away | Microsoft gets less than $10 per Windows Phone unit | Microsoft-Nokia deal: Reaction from the Twitter trenches | Elop drops Nokia CEO role to lead devices team under Microsoft deal\nFurther reading ", " Microsoft is buying Nokia's cell phone business and licensing its patent portfolio, according to both companies.\nIn 2003, Nokia's cell phone market share exceeded 35%. That same year, its phone business alone posted an operating profit of 5.48 billion euros. Today's sale price, which includes 1.65 billion euros in patents, is just 5.44 billion euros. It's been a rough decade.\nNokia's cell phone collapse has been a spectacular one. The Finnish giant dominated the dumbphone era after Motorola, another faded star that recently fell into the hands of a comparative upstart. But it was blindsided by Apple, then deprived of a chance to regain its footing by an even more aggressive Google, which followed close behind.\nThe story, in hindsight, is simple: Nokia did not have a truly compelling smartphone ready when a large segment of the developed world was first compelled by smartphones. Whether this was the result of complacency - Nokia was, in the mid-2000s, the leader of the niche smartphone category - doesn't matter now.\nNokia's miscalculations became impossible to ignore in 2008, the same year Microsoft decided, internally at least, to scrap its ancient and inadequate Windows Mobile platform in favor of something entirely new. Under these circumstances, it's easy to imagine how a sort of camaraderie might have emerged at the time, or at least a mutual sympathy. Certainly a shared interest: to break back into the market from which they had been unceremoniously expelled.\nDuring the next two years, while Microsoft readied Windows Phone 7 and Nokia floundered on, the seeds of Sunday's deal were sewn. A chastened Nokia was a natural partner for the tardy but determined Microsoft; it needed a software solution and Microsoft needed help with hardware. The 2009 vision of 2013 renders clearly: Two giants, united after some missteps, regain their rightful place. By 2010, when the head of Microsoft's Business division left to take the helm at Nokia, the gears were moving. Many at the time wondered if Stephen Elop's time at Nokia would be spent grooming the company for purchase - a foreigner in all possible ways, he began his time at the company with a memo rightly but offensively declaring Nokia's proud platform a failure, and quickly pledged the company's commitment to the still-tiny Windows Phone. It felt like a radical about-face, but no matter: Nokia and Microsoft were going to save each other.\nNow, with Elop returning to Microsoft after a job well done - well, a job, done -that plan has come to fruition. The only problem is that there's little left to save. Windows Phone has barely dented the now much larger smartphone market. Nokia hasn't had a Windows Phone hit. This incongruity - between a successfully executed, slyly strategic long-term merger plan and a much grander, more general sense of failure - might explain Microsoft's deeply strange and somewhat sad stated goals for its Nokia acquisition.\nMicrosoft' s \"Strategic Rationale,\" titled \"Accelerating Growth,\" is a disjointed and bizarre document. It manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic.\nFor example, it lays out a plan to pull in over $45 billion dollars in smartphone revenue by 2018. But it plans on doing this by securing just 15% of the projected global smartphone market - not exactly a world-beating plan, keeping in mind the time frame. Consider: 2018 is five years away. Five years ago was the year the App Store first opened. ", " Hello there,\n\nThere is a pertinent story about a man who was working on an oil platform in the North Sea. He woke up one night from a loud explosion, which suddenly set his entire oil platform on fire. In mere moments, he was surrounded by flames. Through the smoke and heat, he barely made his way out of the chaos to the platform's edge. When he looked down over the edge, all he could see were the dark, cold, foreboding Atlantic waters.\n\nAs the fire approached him, the man had mere seconds to react. He could stand on the platform, and inevitably be consumed by the burning flames. Or, he could plunge 30 meters in to the freezing waters. The man was standing upon a \"burning platform,\" and he needed to make a choice.\n\nHe decided to jump. It was unexpected. In ordinary circumstances, the man would never consider plunging into icy waters. But these were not ordinary times - his platform was on fire. The man survived the fall and the waters. After he was rescued, he noted that a \"burning platform\" caused a radical change in his behaviour.\n\nWe too, are standing on a \"burning platform,\" and we must decide how we are going to change our behaviour.\n\nOver the past few months, I've shared with you what I've heard from our shareholders, operators, developers, suppliers and from you. Today, I'm going to share what I've learned and what I have come to believe.\n\nI have learned that we are standing on a burning platform.\n\nAnd, we have more than one explosion - we have multiple points of scorching heat that are fuelling a blazing fire around us.\n\nFor example, there is intense heat coming from our competitors, more rapidly than we ever expected. Apple disrupted the market by redefining the smartphone and attracting developers to a closed, but very powerful ecosystem.\n\nIn 2008, Apple's market share in the $300+ price range was 25 percent; by 2010 it escalated to 61 percent. They are enjoying a tremendous growth trajectory with a 78 percent earnings growth year over year in Q4 2010. Apple demonstrated that if designed well, consumers would buy a high-priced phone with a great experience and developers would build applications. They changed the game, and today, Apple owns the high-end range.\n\nAnd then, there is Android. In about two years, Android created a platform that attracts application developers, service providers and hardware manufacturers. Android came in at the high-end, they are now winning the mid-range, and quickly they are going downstream to phones under E100. Google has become a gravitational force, drawing much of the industry's innovation to its core.\n\nLet's not forget about the low-end price range. In 2008, MediaTek supplied complete reference designs for phone chipsets, which enabled manufacturers in the Shenzhen region of China to produce phones at an unbelievable pace. By some accounts, this ecosystem now produces more than one third of the phones sold globally - taking share from us in emerging markets.\n\nWhile competitors poured flames on our market share, what happened at Nokia? We fell behind, we missed big trends, and we lost time. At that time, we thought we were making the right decisions; but, with the benefit of hindsight, we now find ourselves years behind.\n\nThe first iPhone shipped in 2007, and we still don't have a product that is close to their experience. Android came on the scene just over 2 years ago, and this week they took our leadership position in smartphone volumes. Unbelievable.\n\nWe have some brilliant sources of innovation inside Nokia, but we are not bringing it to market fast enough. We thought MeeGo would be a platform for winning high-end smartphones. However, at this rate, by the end of 2011, we might have only one MeeGo product in the market.\n\nAt the midrange, we have Symbian. It has proven to be non-competitive in leading markets like North America. Additionally, Symbian is proving to be an increasingly difficult environment in which to develop to meet the continuously expanding consumer requirements, leading to slowness in product development and also creating a disadvantage when we seek to take advantage of new hardware platforms. As a result, if we continue like before, we will get further and further behind, while our competitors advance further and further ahead.\n\nAt the lower-end price range, Chinese OEMs are cranking out a device much faster than, as one Nokia employee said only partially in jest, \"the time that it takes us to polish a PowerPoint presentation.\" They are fast, they are cheap, and they are challenging us.\n\nAnd the truly perplexing aspect is that we're not even fighting with the right weapons. We are still too often trying to approach each price range on a device-to-device basis.\n\nThe battle of devices has now become a war of ecosystems, where ecosystems include not only the hardware and software of the device, but developers, applications, ecommerce, advertising, search, social applications, location-based services, unified communications and many other things. Our competitors aren't taking our market share with devices; they are taking our market share with an entire ecosystem. This means we're going to have to decide how we either build, catalyse or join an ecosystem.\n\nThis is one of the decisions we need to make. In the meantime, we've lost market share, we've lost mind share and we've lost time.\n\nOn Tuesday, Standard & Poor's informed that they will put our A long term and A-1 short term ratings on negative credit watch. This is a similar rating action to the one that Moody's took last week. Basically it means that during the next few weeks they will make an analysis of Nokia, and decide on a possible credit rating downgrade. Why are these credit agencies contemplating these changes? Because they are concerned about our competitiveness.\n\nConsumer preference for Nokia declined worldwide. In the UK, our brand preference has slipped to 20 percent, which is 8 percent lower than last year. That means only 1 out of 5 people in the UK prefer Nokia to other brands. It's also down in the other markets, which are traditionally our strongholds: Russia, Germany, Indonesia, UAE, and on and on and on.\n\nHow did we get to this point? Why did we fall behind when the world around us evolved?\n\nThis is what I have been trying to understand. I believe at least some of it has been due to our attitude inside Nokia. We poured gasoline on our own burning platform. I believe we have lacked accountability and leadership to align and direct the company through these disruptive times. We had a series of misses. We haven't been delivering innovation fast enough. We're not collaborating internally.\n\nNokia, our platform is burning.\n\nWe are working on a path forward -- a path to rebuild our market leadership. When we share the new strategy on February 11, it will be a huge effort to transform our company. But, I believe that together, we can face the challenges ahead of us. Together, we can choose to define our future.\n\nThe burning platform, upon which the man found himself, caused the man to shift his behaviour, and take a bold and brave step into an uncertain future. He was able to tell his story. Now, we have a great opportunity to do the same.\n\nStephen."], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1005, 1069", "docSpanText": "Microsoft's own presentation about the deal, announced on Monday"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "338, 414;487, 538", "docSpanText": "Its acquisition of most of Nokia is the latest acceleration of that strategy<SPAN_SEP>towards the sunlit world of smartphones and tablets"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1147, 1249", "docSpanText": "We cannot risk having Apple or Google foreclose app innovation, integration, distribution or economics"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "4423, 4456;4468, 4506", "docSpanText": "Enterprise are certainly a target<SPAN_SEP>considering the state BlackBerry is in"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2878, 3029;3216, 3326", "docSpanText": "But such a move carries its own risks - Microsoft's success has been build on being hardware agnostic and persuading device manufacturers to support it<SPAN_SEP>If Nokia's rumoured tablet appears too, this will further complicate Microsoft's relations with these partners"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "3414, 3552", "docSpanText": "But, as Holway points out, \"on balance, Microsoft needed to make a bold move into mobile.

We now know Microsoft's answer: The computing giant released a 30-slide presentation today arguing that the move will improve Microsoft's margins on Windows phones, which will allow it to invest more in the platform, which will accelerate sales and market share growth, the Washington Post reports. But John Herrman at Buzzfeed has another explanation: \"Fear of dying alone.\" Here's what he and other pundits are saying: The presentation \"manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic,\" Herman argues-like capturing a whole 15% of the smartphone market. \"It's a fitting end for the close of Microsoft's Ballmer era, during which the company ... missed out on the most important change in consumer electronics in decades\" while remaining profitable in unglamorous ways. Like everyone, Microsoft is trying to ape the Apple model, MobileOpportunity observes. But it's not so sure that's a good idea. \"There already is an apple,\" the blog points out, and other software/hardware hybrid companies, like Palm and BlackBerry, have been crushed under its heel. Maybe Microsoft should have tried to patch up its tried-and-true strategy of licensing its OS. The move risks complicating Microsoft's crucial relationships with other PC and device manufacturers, one analyst tells ZDNet. But he adds that \"Microsoft needed to make a bold move\" or face \"certain terminal decline,\" and that the price it paid for Nokia \"seems extremely reasonable.\" Meanwhile, Matthew Yglesias at Slate digs up a fairly interesting memo from Nokia CEO (and, perhaps, Microsoft heir apparent) Stephen Elop, in which he uses the story of a Deepwater Horizon worker leaping from the burning oil platform-a seemingly desperate, yet necessary move-to explain the company's shift from its own failed OS to Windows Phone.

The state has long been a destination for weddings and honeymoons. And now state officials, as well as hotels and restaurants, are hoping the latest marriage-equality law will spur a new market for wedding tourism.\nWedding planner Keane Akao is showing off a secluded beach wedding site, one of several on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.\n\"You can use the beach for pictures,\" he tells a couple, \"and this is actually called Secret Beach.\"\nHis company, Perfectly Planned Hawaii, offers wedding planning for same-sex couples. Swaying palm trees and clear blue water make for a dream ceremony.\nAkao started his company with his business partner less than six months ago, just before Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie called for a special session to debate same-sex marriage.\n\"People now can look at Hawaii as a destination to have their marriage done legally,\" says Akao, \"and for it to be recognized by the federal government, no matter what state they may live in.\"\nHe has received more than two-dozen confirmations since the bill passed last month.\nOne couple planning to marry in the islands is Cira Abiseid and Cyrilla Owle. Last month, they celebrated their union in a ceremony with family and friends at home in Conway, Ark. But their home state doesn't recognize same-sex marriage, so Owle says they're going to Hawaii to make it official.\n\"I think there's two things that came in effect when planning where we wanted to be married,\" says Owle. \"First, like any couple, we wanted to see where we wanted to go for our honeymoon. So who doesn't want to go to Hawaii for their honeymoon, right? And the second reason was, where could we get a license?\"\n\"Same-sex couples will be attracted to Hawaii for the same reasons that opposite-sex couples are attracted to Hawaii,\" says Sumner La Croix, an economist at the University of Hawaii. \"It's the great weather, it's the warm water, it's the beautiful scenery. And it's also the aloha spirit.\"\nLa Croix estimates that over the next three years, gay marriage will boost tourism in Hawaii by $217 million. Unlike some other states with marriage equality laws, Hawaii already has a booming tourism industry. La Croix believes that gives Hawaii an advantage.\n\"The machinery of marriage is already in place here. There are hotels that are in the marriage business,\" he says. \"They're used to catering to couples who are honeymooning or want to get married or are celebrating a marriage. There are wedding photographers. There are caterers. There's a large number of firms that are specialized in the marriage business.\"\nIn Hawaii, tourism is a $14 billion industry. Now, the island chain is positioning itself for a spike in visitors - among them, Honolulu-based hotel chain Aqua Hospitality. It already offers LGBT travel deals, including the \"out and proud\" package and the \"civil unions romance special.\"\nBigger beachfront resorts are also getting in on the action. The Sheraton Waikiki is the only hotel on Oahu providing on-site marriage licenses. General Manager Kelly Sanders says now the hotel is running a new ad campaign in mainland LGBT publications.\n\"Yes, there's a revenue opportunity,\" says Sanders. \"There's an opportunity for all of us to really have that great success, but in my mind it's something that should have happened already. And so it's just now being able to really open all of our arms as wide as they can be and say welcome.\"\nIt was Hawaii that back in 1991 touched off the national conversation about same-sex marriage. Then, three couples sued to force the state to issue them marriage licenses. Now, more than two decades later, Hawaii is the latest state to recognize marriage equality.

Agents have set up shop throughout the islands, from resorts on Maui and the Big Island to hard-to-reach places on Kauai.\nFor those wanting to get licenses in person, Hawaii's Health Department planned to open its doors at 8 a.m. local time Monday morning.\n\"We started this battle 23 years ago and we get to finish it tonight,\" said Michael Golojuch Jr., chairman on Honolulu Pride and one of the organizers of the midnight weddings at the Sheraton.\nHawaii is often credited with starting the national gay marriage discussion, when couples applying for a marriage license led to a court fight the eventually helped prompt Congress to pass the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. Part of the law was struck down earlier this year by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nGolojuch said the weddings will touch Hawaii in a good way and that businesses have begun to think about how to embrace the gay community.\n\"They opened up their doors to us, their hearts to us,\" Golojuch said. \"That's what we're seeing with a lot of the business community that understands that $217 million is what our economy needs to keep on going.\"\nAn estimate from a University of Hawaii researcher says Hawaii will get a $217 million tourism boost over the next three years as a result of gay marriage.\nHawaii's Legislature _ overwhelmingly comprised of Democrats _ passed the law last month during a special session.

Either way, David Freeland sounded excited as he crossed the threshold where a famous Colonial-era tavern, the Bull's Head, once welcomed thirsty out-of-towners.\n\"There are treasures inside,\" said Mr. Freeland, an author and a historian who researched the site for a book about a beer garden that later occupied the tavern's place on the Bowery.\nPhoto\nBut all he saw was debris from the building's most recent life, as a chain drugstore with a Chinese restaurant upstairs. He did not reach the treasures that thrilled local-history aficionados over the weekend - namely, some old-looking joists and foundation walls in the basement - because the steps were blocked by rubble. The site is to be cleared for a hotel.\nThe joists were discovered by a photographer and preservationist, Adam Woodward, who suspects that structural elements of the Colonial-era tavern were used in the construction of the much larger beer hall, the Atlantic Garden. It reigned as \"one of the show places of New York\" from 1858 on, The New York Times said when it finally shut down in 1911.\nBut what about the tavern where Washington established his temporary headquarters in November 1783 as the British withdrew?\n\"The whole issue of whether the Bull's Head was buried inside the Atlantic Garden was one of the great mysteries of New York,\" Mr. Woodward said.\nUntil, apparently, the other day, when he got a look inside. He saw iron work from the 19th century and I-beams from later on. And then he saw a stairway to the basement, and headed down.\n\"At one point there was a distinct change in the building material, from cinder block to a brick-and-stone foundation wall,\" he said. \"I followed that wall and found myself at the front of the building, under the sidewalk at the Bowery, and looked up and saw what looked to me like 18th-century hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and beams with extremely wide floorboards right above them.\"\nHe said, \"I was thinking, I am standing in the cellar of the Bull's Head.\"\nThe Bull's Head opened around 1750 on the fringe of what was a still-young city concentrated below the Bowery. Washington and his troops marched down the Bowery and stopped there in 1783 before making \"their official entrance into the city proper,\" said Kerri Culhane, a historian who wrote the application that won the Bowery a place on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe neighborhood \"was a butchers' district in the 18th century and the 19th century,\" Ms. Culhane said. \"People drove livestock down from the hinterland and the slaughterhouse was behind the Bowery. That's where the trading took place.\"\nIt was also a home to the ancestors of future V.I.P.'s. \"The Astors started out as butchers,\" she said, but began snapping up land. They even owned the Bull's Head site.\nBut the tavern closed. Mr. Freeland wrote that the building became a store that sold stoves until the Atlantic Garden opened as a beer garden.\nIt was a popular gathering place for German immigrants in its early days, and in the 1870s and 1880s, the Atlantic Garden was raided repeatedly for selling beer on Sundays, when the city's excise laws appeared to forbid that. Mr. Freeland noted that the laws did not mention beer, only \"intoxicating liquors or wines.\" The Atlantic Garden's owner got off after one raid because the judge sampled the beer the police had seized and complained it was so watered down that \"a man might drink by the gallon without getting drunk.\"\nLater still, the Atlantic Garden became \"a place where Tin Pan Alley songwriters would go to plug their songs,\" Mr. Freeland said. One tune that apparently got its start there in the 1890s was \"Daisy Bell,\" the song that turned the phrase \"bicycle built for two\" into a catchphrase.\nMr. Woodward said he hoped the demolition for the hotel could be delayed long enough for \"a proper archaeological exploration.\" (Calls to the owner were not returned on Monday.)\n\"I can't think of another lot in Manhattan that has a more important history,\" Mr. Woodward said, \"and the fact that it might be intact, a couple of feet under the building, is an incredible opportunity to get on archaeological record.\"\n\n", " Elected officials and the Landmarks Preservation Commission are both doing their best to launch a thorough investigation of what may very well be the famed 18th century saloon the Bull's Head Tavern, but their options are limited. Photographer Adam Woodward first documented the ancient, hand-planed wood joists and stone foundation in the basement of 50 Bowery last week, and both he and historian David Freeland are convinced that these are the remnants of Bull's Head. If so, this would be the oldest surviving structure in Manhattan by far, and as Woodward puts it, an \"incredible opportunity to get on archaeological record.\" But the fate of the site depends on the current owner, Alex Chu, who is demolishing the site to make way for a new hotel.\nThe Landmarks Commission tells The Lo-Down that they're \"aware of the situation,\" but \"cannot require the owner to conduct archaeology.\" The best they can do is give the owner a list of good archaeologists. Some elected officials are also getting involved, but again they've got to take it up with Chu first.\n Landmarks Commission: No Jurisdiction to Mandate Historic Site Survey at 50 Bowery [TLD]\n All

Plus join Howard Kurtz for a live chat during the debate, starting at 8pm ET.\nAfter three weeks' respite, the packed Republican presidential debate season is about to return to full tilt. The GOP field will convene in a Detroit suburb on Wednesday for a debate hosted by CNBC. Using a traditional setup, the debate is supposed to focus on economic issues, including taxation, jobs, and the deficit, but fireworks are likely on a few other topics as well. Here's what to watch for Wednesday night.\n1. Will the Herman Cain Allegations Take Center Stage?\nLast time around, Herman Cain was a target because his fortunes were rising, along with the popularity of his 9-9-9 plan. Much has happened since, and although his polls numbers have flat-lined, not tanked, repeated allegations of sexual harassment or worse seem to be on their way to derailing the Cain train. How will his rivals handle it? They could attack him directly; even the usually detached Romney edged that way Tuesday, saying the allegations against Cain were serious. But that might be unnecessary and counterproductive. Focusing on Cain's circus rather than, say, high unemployment is bad for the Republican brand, so they may instead let him bleed slowly as they avert their eyes.\n2. Will the 'Not-Mitt' Movement Dent Romney's Armor?\nAlthough it's long been clear that Mitt Romney was the man to beat in the Republican field, the last two weeks have seen the anybody-but-Mitt movement crystallizing like never before. Bookended by scathing attacks by George Will and Erick Erickson-the voices of the Old Republican Establishment and the Upstart Activist Right, respectively-and peaking with the creation of the website Not Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor's opponents have come together, Transformers-style. But behind whom? With most of the rest of the field fading or too damaged to take up the standard, Jon Huntsman Jr., whose once-promising candidacy hasn't even gotten as far as spinning its wheels, is making a late play, producing his own anti-Romney ad. Can Huntsman or some other challenger dent Romney's armor? Or will the unflappable frontrunner parry all blows with the effortless, bland approach he's used so far?\n3. Will Newt Gingrich Finally Join the First Tier?\nWith Cain potentially on the outs, could Newt Gingrich finally be having his moment? The former House speaker could appeal to the same voters as Cain (they agree on plenty, as demonstrated by their lovefest on Saturday), he's experienced, and his campaign seems to have come back from several prematurely declared deaths. Indeed, he's rising in some polls. But Gingrich's previous debate performances have been polarizing. While some of the more cerebral Republican pundits gushed over his oratorical and rhetorical talents, he has a tendency to come across as petulantly contrarian and needlessly pedantic. If he can temper those tendencies, the debate could propel him to the first tier of the race.\n4. Will Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann Show Up?\nLong, long ago-if you can remember that far back-both Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry were first-tier candidates. Their chances at returning to the top tier are slipping away quickly, though Perry's ample war chest is a crutch. It will be interesting to see how they try to claw back-if at all.

It declined to comment on the nature or extent of the damage. Lin Wood, a spokesman for Wynn, declined to comment.\nThe painting, which measures a little more than 4-by-2 1/2 feet and estimated at $70 million, was one of three Wynn consigned to Christie's for sale this week for a total of as much as $135 million, according to the auction house's estimates. On Monday, Picasso's 1964 portrait of a woman with a cat, \"Femme au chat assise dans un fauteuil,\" was also pulled from the auction by mutual agreement with the seller, Christie's said. That piece, also owned by Wynn, is estimated at $25 million to $35 million.\nWynn, who suffers from a disease that affects his peripheral vision, accidentally struck his Picasso \"Le Reve\" with his right elbow in 2006 while showing it to friends in his Las Vegas office, leaving a hole the size of a silver dollar. The painting had been worth $139 million before that, according to Wynn's lawsuit against the insurer, Lloyd's of London. A restorer said the repaired painting was worth $85 million, according to the lawsuit. Hedge fund titan Steve Cohen bought it from Wynn in 2013 for $155 million.\n\"Femme au chat assise dans un fauteuil\" Photographer: Katya Kazakina/Bloomberg\nBoth withdrawn paintings had been guaranteed by Christie's and backed by third-party guarantees. The withdrawal of a work from sale removes any guarantee made for the transaction, Christie's said, adding that its consignment contracts \"have insurance provisions to cover damage and other contingencies.\"\nWynn resigned as chief executive officer of Wynn Resorts Ltd. in February amid sexual-misconduct allegations. He has denied wrongdoing.\nThe other Wynn lot at Christie's is Andy Warhol's 1963 \"Double Elvis [Ferus Type],\" which will be offered as planned at the postwar and contemporary evening sale on May 17, Christie's said. Estimated at more than $30 million, it depicts Elvis Presley dressed as a cowboy and shooting from the hip.\nThe painting last appeared at auction in 2012 when it fetched $37 million at Sotheby's. At the time it was bought by the Mugrabi family, which owns one of the world's largest private Warhol collections.\n- With assistance by Peter Jeffrey ", " Follow\nALBRECHT DURER (1471-1528) The Four Horsemen of the Apocal..."], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "367, 376;387, 395;460, 597", "docSpanText": "Picasso's<SPAN_SEP>portrait<SPAN_SEP>was damaged Friday \"during the final stages of preparation\" for auction Tuesday and pulled from the block, Christie's said in a statement"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "714, 726;782, 806", "docSpanText": "The painting<SPAN_SEP>estimated at $70 million"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "599, 659", "docSpanText": "It declined to comment on the nature or extent of the damage"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "74, 127;164, 176;243, 365", "docSpanText": "Steve Wynn's plan to sell a pair of Picasso paintings<SPAN_SEP>was derailed<SPAN_SEP>years after the billionaire collector and erstwhile casino magnate put his elbow through another masterpiece by the artist"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1219, 1286;1288, 1410", "docSpanText": "Wynn, who suffers from a disease that affects his peripheral vision<SPAN_SEP>accidentally struck his Picasso \"Le Reve\" with his right elbow in 2006 while showing it to friends in his Las Vegas office"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1456, 1508;1665, 1681;1694, 1713;1722, 1738", "docSpanText": "The painting had been worth $139 million before that<SPAN_SEP>Hedge fund titan<SPAN_SEP>bought it from Wynn<SPAN_SEP>for $155 million"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2123, 2231", "docSpanText": "Wynn resigned as chief executive officer of Wynn Resorts Ltd. in February amid sexual-misconduct allegations"}], "summary": "Pricey mistake: A Picasso worth an estimated $70 million had to be yanked from an auction at Christie's this week because it sustained damage as workers were preparing it.

North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue declared a state of emergency for counties east of Interstate 95.\nA Category 2 storm has winds of at least 96 mph, and poorly constructed homes are at risk for losing their roofs, high-rise windows can be broken and many shallow-rooted trees will be snapped off or pulled from the ground, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\"No matter which way you slice it, there's probably going to be hurricane-force winds in New York,\" said Eric Wilhelm, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania.\nForecast Track\nSmall fluctuations in the track, which currently passes directly over Queens, could mean much greater damage to the city from storm surge, Wilhelm said.\nIrene is expected to strengthen later today, the hurricane center said, and could become a Category 4 storm on the five- step Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, bearing winds of at least 131 mph.\n\"The hurricane will affect millions and cost billions,\" Wilhelm said. \"This will be remembered as a Northeast hurricane and not a North Carolina hurricane.\"\nA hurricane watch is in force from Surf City, North Carolina, to the Virginia line, according to the center. A tropical storm watch is in effect from Edisto Beach, South Carolina, to Surf City. A watch means storm conditions are likely to begin in two days.\nGovernor's Warning\nNorth Carolina's Perdue told reporters today she was \"dismayed that many of the ferries were still empty\" at Ocracoke Island, which is evacuating tourists. \"We are asking people all over eastern North Carolina to take this storm very seriously,\" she said.\nThe U.S. Navy moved 64 ships away from Norfolk, Virginia, to keep them from being damaged by the storm, the Associated Press reported.\nThe dedication of the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial on the National Mall in Washington on Aug. 28, at which President Barack Obama is scheduled to speak, is still on schedule.\nResidents along the coast north of the Carolinas will \"experience a raging hurricane,\" said Jim Dale, a risk meteorologist with High Wycombe, England-based British Weather Services. \"They will see 70-100 miles-per-hour winds and also copious amounts of rain. Flooding and storm damage from wind is inevitable.\"\nBahamas Impact\nIrene is ripping through the Bahamas with winds of 115 miles per hour, damaging homes, felling trees and triggering flooding, according to the Bahamas Emergency Management Agency.\nThe U.S. center warned the Bahamas would experience storm surges of as much as 11 feet above sea level and that up to 12 inches of rain may fall. Irene's hurricane-strength winds of at least 74 mph extend 70 miles from its core, and tropical-storm- strength winds reach out 290 miles.\nThe last hurricane to strike the U.S. was Ike in 2008, a Category 2 storm when it went ashore near Galveston, Texas. The most recent major hurricane, one with winds of at least 111 mph, was Wilma in 2005.\nFarther east in the Atlantic, Tropical Depression 10 probably will be upgraded to a tropical storm today, the center said. The next tropical storm will be named Jose.\nThe system is about 505 miles west of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands and moving west-northwest across open waters at 12 mph, the Miami-based center said.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Brian K. Sullivan in Boston at bsullivan10@bloomberg.net.\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Bill Banker at bbanker@bloomberg.net ", " As massive Hurricane Irene advanced toward the Eastern Seaboard with 115-mph winds, officials issued a hurricane warning for the entire North Carolina coast to the Virginia border, New York ordered low-lying hospitals and nursing homes to evacuate, and at least seven states declared emergencies.If Irene follows its current projected path, it will make landfall along North Carolina's Outer Banks on Saturday. The Category 3 storm withdrew from the Bahamas late Thursday, traveling north at 14 mph, the National Hurricane Center said.Although North Carolina will take the first blow, \"The rest of the Eastern Seaboard is well within the path of this storm,\" National Hurricane Center Director Bill Read said.North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Delaware and Connecticut declared states of emergency.\"This could be a 100-year event,\" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said.runtime:topic id=\"PLGEO100100804000000\">New York City officials said they might have to suspend all mass transit beginning Saturday.In addition to ordering nursing homes and hospitals in low-lying coastal areas to evacuate ahead of possible flooding, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg advised residents to stay out of parks.\"Because of the high winds that will accompany the storm, we are also urging all New Yorkers, for their own safety, to stay out of parks, where the high winds will increase the danger of downed trees and limbs,\" Bloomberg said. \"And incidentally, it's a good idea to stay out of your own backyard if you have trees there.\"Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial postponed it indefinitely.The hurricane center warned of tidal surges 5 to 10 feet high in North Carolina, accompanied by \"destructive and life-threatening waves.\" Projections show Irene making landfall between Morehead City, N.C., and Cape Hatteras before pushing north. Irene could inundate the state's coastal areas with 6 to 10 inches of rain, and up to 15 inches in some locations, forecasters said.More than 50 million people live in the projected path of the storm. Some forecasters have said Irene has an outside chance of growing into a Category 4 storm, with sustained winds topping 130 mph. But current forecasts predict it will diminish to Category 2 after pummeling North Carolina, with sustained winds up to 110 mph as it plows into Virginia, Maryland and Delaware.North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue declared an emergency in all counties east of Interstate 95, about a quarter of the state, and officials set up emergency shelters inland. President Obama declared North Carolina an emergency too, expediting federal help.The Federal Emergency Management Agency established a depot for food, water, generators, baby formula and other emergency supplies at Ft. Bragg, N.C., as well as at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey and Westover Air Reserve Base in Massachusetts.Cars loaded with coolers and surfboards fled the Outer Banks on Thursday, as people heeded orders to leave the exposed barrier islands. Tourists' vehicles clogged the main highway north to Virginia, and traffic on roads leading inland grew heavier as the day wore on.Up to 200,000 tourists and residents are affected by evacuation orders in North Carolina alone, with states to the north rushing to prepare their own evacuation plans. Forecasters said Irene was so big and powerful that severe road flooding and widespread electrical outages were likely, especially in the Northeast, where the ground is saturated from recent rains.\"This is a very dangerous storm,\" said Dorothy Toolan of the Dare County Emergency Management office in Manteo, N.C., across the Roanoke Sound from Nags Head . \"People really need to take this seriously.\"Irene would be the first hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland since Ike devastated the Texas coast in 2008.Facing a two-hour delay on the highway north to their home in Virginia, sisters Susan Wright and Beth Edwards decided to stick around and enjoy a final day in the sun and sand in Nags Head - complete with mimosa cocktails.

For us Ramadan is a really special time so it's really important to make people happy and reward them,\" said Hussain.\nHis show -- Aman Ramazan -- has been dubbed Pakistan's version of The Price Is Right, with members of the 500-strong audience receiving prizes in exchange for answering questions on the Quran.\nThe giveaway bonanza includes motorbikes, microwave ovens, washing machines and fridges.\nHe also cooks while men sing Islamic hymns and discusses religion with children in a garden full of rabbits, snakes and goats.\nThe baby girls given away on the show were found by an NGO, the Chhipa Welfare Association , which says it receives up to 15 abandoned babies a month.\n\"Our team finds babies abandoned on the street, in garbage bins -- some of them dead, others mauled by animals. So why not ensure the baby is kept alive and gets a good home?\" said Ramzan Chhipa, who runs the organization.\n\"We didn't just give the baby away. We have our own vetting procedure. This couple was already registered with us and had four or five sessions with us.\"\nBut, the couple didn't know they would be handed a newborn when they were invited to take part in the show and paperwork was not processed before the live broadcast.\nAdoption is not officially recognized in Pakistan and there is no adoption law. The couple will have to apply for guardianship at a family court.\nSome viewers praised the show's baby giveaway but others declared it a publicity stunt.\n\"Pakistan wake up,\" Shamim Mahmood wrote on the NGO's Facebook page. \"Babies are not trophies to be handed to just anyone.\"\nHussain says it isn't a gimmick to win ratings during the Islamic holy month. He believes his show is unifying a fractured nation, plagued by sectarian violence, religious intolerance and terrorism.\n\"These are the disenfranchised babies that grow up to be street kids and used for suicide bombing attacks. We have tried to show an alternative,\" he said.\n\"Telling people to take these kids off the rubbish on the streets, raise them and make them a responsible citizen, not to destroy society through terrorism,\" he said.\nThe show has proved extremely popular, breaking ratings records and may be extended beyond its Ramadan run. He is also planning another program where the audience will be from the minority Hindu, Sikh and Christian communities.\n\"We've created a symbol of peace and love, that's our show's theme -- to spread love. I'm setting an example. Giving a childless couple an abandoned child,\" Hussain said. ", " 1 of 8. A childless couple kisses their newly adopted daughter, Fatima, whom Pakistani television talk show host Aamir Liaquat Hussain gave them on his show, as they sit at the Chhipa Welfare Association office in Karachi August 1, 2013.\nISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani television is screening what many call its most controversial content yet in a ruthless quest for ratings: a talk-show host who gives away babies live on air.\nAamir Liaquat Hussain, a bespectacled 41-year-old with a neatly trimmed beard, gave away two abandoned infant girls to childless families last month and plans to give away a baby boy this week.\n\"If we didn't find this baby, a cat or a dog would have eaten it,\" Hussain proclaimed during one broadcast, before presenting a tiny girl wrapped in pink and red to her new parents. The audience erupted with applause.\nHussain is one of Pakistan's most popular talk-show hosts. During his marathon broadcasts he cooks, interviews clerics and celebrities, entertains children and hosts game shows.\nHe usually gives prizes like motorbikes, mobile phones and land deeds to audience members who answer questions about Islam.\nBut at the beginning of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan, when television stations battle fiercely for ratings, Hussain astonished Pakistan when he presented two families with babies.\n\"We were told that we had passed all the interviews and had been selected to adopt a baby,\" said Riaz Uddin, 40, an engineer. \"We got our baby on live TV.\"\nThe abandoned babies were rescued by the Chhipa Welfare Association, a Pakistani aid organization.\n\"In a day or two, the next baby will be given away, God willing,\" its head, Ramzan Chhipa, told Reuters on Thursday.\nWhile the Chhipa teams scour the garbage dumps and other sites for discarded newborns, Hussain is also appealing for babies directly.\n\"If any family cannot afford to bring up their new born baby due to poverty or illness then instead of killing them, they should hand over the baby to Dr Aamir,\" a notice on his website reads. The children would be given to deserving couples on air, the notice said.\nThe show's producers did not return Reuters calls seeking comment. It was not clear if poor families wishing to keep their children would also be helped.\nFIGHTING FOR VIEWERS\nMany Pakistanis expressed disgust that abandoned babies were being given away in what they see as an attempt to boost ratings. Chhipa insisted thousands of people wanted a baby and all potential parents were properly vetted.\nThe true outrage, he said, was the poverty forcing families to abandon children.\nHussain's show is one of many such broadcasts. The Pakistani media has flourished over the past decade or so following the liberalization of the industry, particularly broadcasting, after decades of tight state control.\nNow, instead of battling state restrictions, presenters fight for audiences and advertising by seeing who is most outrageous.\nRecent episodes include a female anchor stalking couples in a park to challenge their morality, and a news program which once ran a live broadcast showing a staff member bleeding to death in an operating theatre after he was shot in a riot.\nEven among this company, Hussain stands out. In 2008, he hosted scholars who called for the deaths of Ahmadis, a persecuted religious sect in Pakistan. Within a day, two prominent Ahmadis had been shot dead.\nThe year before, he had to resign from his post as junior minister for religious affairs after denouncing author Salman Rushdie for blasphemy, a crime punished by death in Pakistan.\nSince then, his university degree has been exposed as a fake and a video showing him making crude jokes with clerics between takes of his show has leaked onto YouTube.\n\"There is nothing they won't do to get viewers,\" said comedian Sami Shah. \"If I was a cynic, I'd say this can only end badly.

", " Advertisement\nRecently received a new credit card that has a microchip on its front? Wondering about the change?\nCredit cards with security chips are a part of the new card processing system being adopted by the U.S., whereby the card used by a consumer will have a special microchip that will need to be inserted in a reader rather than swiped at a checkout terminal to close a transaction.\nThe new credit cards look like any old credit card except that they have a tiny metallic chip on the front. The chip-embedded cards deploy EMV microchips, which is short for Europay, MasterCard and Visa. This system is already in use in several parts of Europe.\nThe microchip basically contains a user's payment information, which so far was contained on the magnetic strip. The microchip also gives a novel code which is different for every purchase.\nThe transition to chip-enabled credit cards will make life more difficult for criminals as they are more secure than magnetic strip-only cards.\nHow? Because the microprocessor in the microchips - which is like a mini computer - adds an additional layer of security for each transaction.\nAccording to Visa's Stephanie Erickson, Head of Authentication Product Integration, while criminals were able to make counterfeit physical copies of magnetic strip-based cards, the chip-based cards will make the process more difficult. Since the chips contain data relating to a specific purchase, their reproduction is tough.\n\"They can't create a counterfeit card which is two-thirds of the fraud we see in the system,\" says Erickson.\nMoreover, Erickson opines that countries which shifted to this technology within two years of the transition, saw the counterfeit reduce by 60 to 70 percent.\nSome may argue that the unique transaction code generated by the chip every single time the credit card is used may lead to a compromise. However, experts alleviate the fear by assuring that even if the code was gotten hold of by a thief it would be worthless.\nOne, however, would still be required to sign even when deploying a chip-based card.\nWhile the new system promises more safety, a downside of the new microchip-based credit cards is that they take longer to process when compared to the older system. If an old swipe transaction took three to five seconds, then this \"dip\" method takes between five to ten seconds.\nThe increased time for transaction would impact the lines at the checkout and could be a problem especially during high-traffic periods such as Black Friday.\nOn Oct. 1, merchants - not card issuers - will be responsible for fraudulent transactions if they don't upgrade their payment terminals.\n(c) 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission. ", " On Thursday, merchants who cannot process chip-enabled cards could become liable for fraudulent transactions at their stores. MasterCard and Visa set the deadline for the new rules, which are part of their agreements with the retailers and banks that use their networks. American Express will shift liability on Oct. 16.\nConsumers, however, will not be caught in the middle. Federal law requires banks to reimburse consumers for different types of fraud. The only difference is that, come Thursday, banks could go after retailers that have not properly updated their equipment.\nNot everyone will have chip-enabled cards by the deadline. While most customers at the big banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America will receive their cards by the end of the year, some will not get new cards until 2016. Some issuers will also wait until customers' existing cards are close to expiring.\nCredit and debit cards without chips will continue to work until they expire, or until consumers activate their new cards. And they will still work at payment terminals that have been updated to accommodate chips.\nBut new machines will prompt users who swipe a chip card to dip it instead.\n\"You should always use the chip device, not the swipe device,\" said Ed Mierzwinski, the consumer program director of U.S. PIRG, the federation of state public interest groups."], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "845, 987", "docSpanText": "The transition to chip-enabled credit cards will make life more difficult for criminals as they are more secure than magnetic strip-only cards"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1002, 1038;1073, 1130", "docSpanText": "the microprocessor in the microchips<SPAN_SEP>adds an additional layer of security for each transaction"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1368, 1428;1460, 1496", "docSpanText": "Since the chips contain data relating to a specific purchase<SPAN_SEP>They can't create a counterfeit card"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2133, 2165;2179, 2201", "docSpanText": "new microchip-based credit cards<SPAN_SEP>take longer to process"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "15, 85", "docSpanText": "Recently received a new credit card that has a microchip on its front?"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "393, 413;461, 499", "docSpanText": "The new credit cards<SPAN_SEP>have a tiny metallic chip on the front"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "655, 766", "docSpanText": "The microchip basically contains a user's payment information, which so far was contained on the magnetic strip"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "768, 987", "docSpanText": "The microchip also gives a novel code which is different for every purchase.\nThe transition to chip-enabled credit cards will make life more difficult for criminals as they are more secure than magnetic strip-only cards"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2520, 2644", "docSpanText": "merchants -

USA TODAY Sports\nCubs player Kyle Schwarber hits an RBI single against the Indians in the fifth inning of Game 2. (Photo: Charles LeClaire, USA TODAY Sports)\nCLEVELAND - It no longer defies imagination, but assaults the senses, wondering how sheer and utter fantasy could become reality.\nHow in the world could a baseball player spend six months just learning to walk again after a devastating knee injury, not playing in a single game, and lead the Chicago Cubs to their first World Series victory since 1945, with a 5-1 victory over the Cleveland Indians, evening the Series at 1-game apiece?\n\"It's the 'Legend of Kyle Schwarber,' \" catcher David Ross said.\nAnd the way this narrative is playing out, Cubs third baseman Kris Bryant predicts, it will soon be coming to a movie theater near you.\n\"I can't even describe what he's doing right now,\" said left fielder Ben Zobrist, who's hitting .625 this series and is like a back-drop to center stage. \"No one's ever seen anything like it.\"\nThere has never been a position player in baseball history whose first hit of the season was in the World Series until Schwarber came along. He doubled off Cleveland ace Corey Kluber in Game 1, and then went 2-for-4 with two RBI and a walk in Wednesday's victory.\n\"He better not take one single swing in the offseason,\" first baseman Anthony Rizzo said.\nIndeed, the dude is making a total mockery out of spring training, let alone rehab assignments.\nThis is a guy who had no hits in four at-bats in April before he blew out his left knee. He had one hit in eight at-bats in the Arizona Fall League. Now, on baseball's greatest stage, he is hitting .429, reaching base five times in nine at-bats, with a double, two singles and two RBI.\nIf he keeps this up, and Schwarber leads the Cubs to their first World Series title since 1908, there will be generations of Schwarbers who will never have to pay for a drink or adult beverage in their lifetimes in the city of Chicago.\n\"If we win three more,\" Rizzo said, \"he doesn't have to take another swing in his life. Take your time, and enjoy your life.\"\nConsidering that Schwarber has all of four months of baseball experience on his bubble-gum card, and is baseball's ultimate gym rat, there's a better chance of him conducting hitting lessons when he's 80 than ever giving up this gig.\n\"He's just a dirt bag,\" Rizzo said. \"He's always around the field. He's always watching baseball. Always watching film. Sometimes, too much.\n\"When he was on the DL, he's there watching film, studying scouting reports, and I would yell at him, 'What are you doing? What are you doing?' \"\nWho realized all along that Schwarber was secretly plotting his comeback?\n\"Baseball's a crazy game,\" Schwarber said. \"It will do crazy things to you.\"\nSo crazy, that he went along with the Cubs' narrative, that he would be out for the season. When you tear two knee ligaments, no one expects to see you until next season. If he had only sustained the injury earlier, maybe in spring training, he'd have a chance, but not during the season.\nAnd even if he was physically able to return before the end of the season, there would be no time for a minor-league rehab assignment, no time to get down his timing, no time to see major-league pitching.\n\"That's why we're calling it 'The Legend of Kyle Schwarber,' \" Ross said. \"That's who does this. It just blows my mind what he's doing. He's doing things that are unheard of.\"\nYet, on baseball's biggest stage, in front of millions on national TV, Schwarber is turning the World Series into his own reality TV show.\nWatch Schwarber become the Cubs' first DH in World Series history. Watch Schwarber hit. Watch Schwarber run. Watch Schwarber drive in two runs.\nOh, and if you need to tug at the heartstrings too, watch Schwarber become emotional talking about his 10-year-old friend, Campbell Faulkner of Queen Creek, Ariz.\nFaulkner, diagnosed with a rare form of mitochondrial disease, has a team of 13 doctors. He struggles to stand and walk for extended periods of time. He needs two feeding tubes in his stomach just to provide him with nutrition. He missed nearly 100 days of school last year because of his illness and doctor appointments.\nSchwarber met him in spring training and saw him last weekend before meeting the Cubs in the World Series. Faulkner is his friend, and Schwarber wears a bright green wristband in his honor to make those aware of the disease.\n\"Really young, smart kid, and he's just always got a big smile on his face,\" Schwarber said. \"You know, that draws your attention to him. He's living life to his fullest, even though he's got something to overcome.\n\"He's just a good kid. How could you not like him?\"\nIt's all part of the legend of Schwarber, the 23-year-old who became the Cubs' all-time postseason home run leader last year by hitting five homers in just 27 at-bats, and now is doing what no one can possibly believe they're seeing.\n\"For a guy to be able to do something like this,\" winning pitcher Jake Arrieta said. \"is just ... I'm kind of speechless.\"\nIn the words of Cleveland manager Terry Francona, who suffered his first World Series loss a manager in 10 games: \"I can see why Theo (Epstein) sent a plane for him. I would too. That's a lot to ask, but special players can do special things.\"\nEpstein, president of the Cubs, was stunned when the six-month medical reports last week revealed Schwarber was a month ahead of schedule. Schwarber was so excited, he asked for permission to go to the Arizona Fall League, to see how he looked. He played two games, did all the agility drills, ran the bases, slid, and with Epstein watching the video of him on his computer, took the gamble. He sent a private plane for him Monday, and on Tuesday, was in the starting lineup batting fifth.\nNow, the question an inquiring, starving, championship-drought fan base wants to know: Could the Cubs dare put him in the field this weekend against the Indians? They are going back to National League rules. There will be no DH at Wrigley Field. Can he possibly play the field when he hasn't played the outfield since tearing two knee ligaments on April 7?\n\"He may be catching for all we know,\" Rizzo said.\nWell, it's safe to say he won't be catching until next spring, but considering the way he's running the bases every time he's aboard, there's a certain manager who will be pushing for the cause.\n\"I'm waiting to hear from our guys from our medical side,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said, \"because obviously he looks good. He looks good at the plate. Running the bases, he looks pretty good so far.\n\"There's nothing about watching him that tells me that he's inhibited right now.\n\"He's a different cat, he absolutely is.\"\nIt's one thing if there had been the scintilla of discussion that Schwarber could possibly be ready for the playoffs, even privately among the Cubs' front office. Or even if Schwarber had told a few teammates that this was his secret plan all along. But nothing. Absolutely nothing.\nSure, there were times during the season when Schwarber would tease his teammates, saying he'd be back for that day-night doubleheader in August against the Milwaukee Brewers, and everyone would laugh. It was a running joke all season. The laughter stopped when Rizzo was having dinner with strength coach Tim Buss before Game 3 of the NLCS in Los Angeles.\n\"I said, 'What?' \" Rizzo said. \" 'Seriously? For real?' I couldn't believe it.\"\nThe Cubs still can't.\n\"I just took it day by day,\" Schwarber said. \"There were days I just wasn't feeling it. My teammates picked me up and I had some guys come over and say to me, 'World Series, you're coming back.' I'd just laugh it off.\n\"Then, when it came to reality, it was a shock.\"\nImagine how the rest of us feel.\n\"The Legend of Kyle Schwarber,\" Ross slowly said again.\nStay tuned. The sequel is Friday, the first World Series night game in Wrigley Field history.\n\"They are going to go nuts,\" Ross said.\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter and Facebook\nGallery: Cubs, Indians clash in World Series ", " CLEVELAND - \"They're going to make a movie about him,\" Kris Bryant said.\nBryant might be right. But even after two jaw-dropping performances, the climax of \"Legend: The Amazing Comeback of Kyle Schwarber,\" lies ahead.\nYes, the word, \"legend,\" is admittedly lofty for a player who is only 23, but that's the description several of his teammates chose, not me.\nFilming resumes Friday night at Wrigley Field, in Game 3 of the World Series, with the Cubs and Indians tied at one game each.\nThe next plot twist - \"Will Schwarbs be in left field?\" - likely will not be a twist at all. He will be in left. He will receive a standing ovation for the ages. He will hit a ball into Lake Michigan, and then ride a chariot down Michigan Avenue, woe to any billy goat that stands in the way.\nThe Cubs, according to president of baseball operations Theo Epstein, have yet to decide whether Schwarber will be in the outfield. Doctors initially cleared him only to hit and run the bases, serve as a DH. But the Cubs will talk to the doctors again on Friday.\nThe team does not intend to put Schwarber in jeopardy. But Epstein and others say they view him as healed from the surgery he underwent to repair two damaged ligaments a little more than six months ago.\n\"He's got tremendous strength and flexibility in the knee, as demonstrated by what he's done out there,\" Epstein said, referring to Schwarber's double and walk in Game 1, his two RBI singles and walk in Game 2, the quality of his at-bats overall.\n\"We'll see. If he does end up playing out there, we'll make sure he's smart about it. If he doesn't, we'll put him in a big spot (as a pinch-hitter) to take one of the most important at-bats of the game.\"\nThree days ago, a lot of people thought the Cubs were nuts to even consider giving Schwarber his first start since April 7 in Game 1 of the World Series. Now, many of those same people are saying, \"How can the Cubs not keep playing him?\"\nThere is risk. There is always risk. At some point, this becomes a question of protecting Schwarber from himself. \"He'll run through a wall. He'll do anything,\" Cubs general manager Jed Hoyer said. \"But that's on us to make sure we check all the right boxes.\"\nSchwarber prepared for the Series by tracking 1,300 pitches from a pitching machine at the Cubs' spring-training facility in Mesa, Az. He did not, however, track 1,300 flyballs. And he was a below-average outfielder even before he got injured in a collision with center fielder Dexter Fowler.\nStill, as Epstein indicated, the Cubs can proceed with relative caution. Replace Schwarber for defense if they get a lead. Use him off the bench in Games 4 and 5, when two flyball pitchers, John Lackey and Jon Lester, are scheduled to pitch.\nHeck, the Cubs will benefit even if Schwarber cannot play the field and is limited to one at-bat per game. In Game 1, Schwarber hit a double off a dominant Corey Kluber and drew a walk off the hellacious Andrew Miller. In Game 2, he drilled one RBI single off Trevor Bauer on a 3-0 count, the other off reliever Bryan Shaw after falling behind 0-2.\nHe has seen 40 pitches in nine plate appearances, a rate that would nearly have led the majors if sustained over a full season. He is hitting as if he missed no time, taking pitches inches off the plate, repeating his short, powerful swing with seemingly no effort. You hear baseball people talk about players who can roll out of bed and hit. Schwarber practically did.\n\"The professional at-bats just blow my mind,\" catcher David Ross said. \"The eye he has at the plate, taking pitches, taking walks. There is not a more impressive thing that I've seen in a long time than the Andrew Miller at-bat (Tuesday). I thought (manager) Joe (Maddon) might pinch-hit for him. Who's the idiot? Me.\"\nYet, the Cubs are the people least surprised by all this. They understand that Schwarber possesses rare offensive gifts. They know how much he cares about the club. And they saw how hard he worked to return.\n\"This guy has been running in pools, doing rehab stuff the entire summer, hoping somehow he could contribute,\" Hoyer said. \"We let him rehab in Chicago because he was such a big part of it, so great to be around.\n\"A lot of guys we wouldn't have allowed to stay here. But with him, he's such a good teammate, he wants it so badly. If he had any possibility he was going to come back and help us, he was going to do it.\"\nMost players, Ross said, would have \"checked out\" after suffering such a major injury; they would have gone home, done their rehab, played with their kids and prepared for the following season.\nSchwarber was different. Schwarber always was part of the team.\n\"All of this was for these guys in the clubhouse and our organization,\" he said. \"It wasn't for me.\"\nThe players could not help but notice.\n\"He stayed locked in when he was hurt,\" Ross said. \"Mentally, he's been competing in his mind for a long time with us.\n\"Our new weight room has all mirrors. You look in there and he was in a full sweat by the time I get to the field. He's got his day in before we start and he stays, does all his rehab, stays for the game, grinds out the game with us, cheering guys on, watching video, doing scouting reports. He's a baseball rat.\"\nCall Hollywood. Hold Wrigley. And if the doctors say OK, clear out left field.\nLights! Schwarber!

As in, \"The Legend of Kyle Schwarber\" as the Chicago Cubs catcher puts it, per USA Today. The 23-year-old suffered a devastating knee injury in the third game of the season on April 7 and sat out the rest of the year. In a surprise move, the Cubs put him back in the lineup for the World Series as a designated hitter. After doubling in Game 1-one of the few bright spots for the Cubs that game, which came after TV analyst Pete Rose predicted he'd strike out three times-Schwarber had two RBI singles in the Cubs' Game 2 victory and scored another run himself. He's batting .429 with two walks. \"They're going to make movies about him,\" says teammate Kris Bryant. No position player has ever recorded his first hit of the season in the World Series. And his \"eye\" at the plate is astonishing his teammates, notes the Chicago Tribune. The problem for the Cubs is that Schwarber is not medically cleared to play the outfield, but that could change before Friday's game in Chicago, where no designated hitter is allowed. But \"the next plot twist- \"Will Schwarbs be in left field?'-likely will not be a twist at all,\" writes Ken Rosenthal at Fox Sports. \"He will be in left.

", " TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Drivers who drink coffee behind the wheel don't need to worry about getting a ticket in New Jersey any time soon.\nThe sponsor of a bill targeting distracted driving says his measure doesn't specifically cite coffee, despite recent news reports focusing on the beverage.\nDemocratic Assemblyman John Wisniewski said the legislation is aimed at discouraging distracted driving and that he cannot imagine that a police officer would pull anyone over for drinking coffee.\nCurrent law already prohibits texting or talking without a hands-free device. The new legislation is broader and would bar \"any activity unrelated to the actual operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that interferes with the safe operation of the vehicle.\"\nWisniewski says he sponsored the bill , which doesn't mention eating or drinking, to avoid the need for new legislation every time technology changes.\nHe introduced the measure seven months ago, but he has yet to bring it up for a vote in a committee he leads. It also never came up for a vote in the two previous legislative sessions in which he introduced similar bills.\nWisniewski said he was surprised by the reaction to the legislation. He said the outcry against the bill has been so strong that his inbox has filled up even more than when he proposed a 25-cent-per-gallon increase in the gas tax.\nWisniewski said when he introduced the bill before, people worried he was trying to stop them from eating sandwiches while driving.\n\"It was the 'ham sandwich bill' last time,\" he said. \"Now it's coffee.\" ", " Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ", " Put down the coffee, bagel or hairbrush and drive! Or else!\nA bill winding its way through Trenton would impose stiff fines and even a possible license suspension for drivers who eat, drink, groom, read or use electronic devices behind the wheel.\nViolators could face a $200 to $400 fine for the first offense and a $400 to $600 fine for a second offense. A third or subsequent offense could mean a fine of $600 to $800 and up to a 90 day license suspension, as well as motor vehicle points.\nThe sponsors of the bill, Assemblyman John Wisniewski, D- Middlesex and Nicholas Chiaravalloti, D-Hudson, said it is modeled after a law in Maine and is intended to educate, not punish drivers.\n\"The issue is that we need to try, in every way, to discourage distracted driving, it's dangerous,\" Wisniewski said. \"Education and enforcement can change the attitudes of people.\"\nSome experts say that motorists must be discouraged from multitasking while driving. Others say the bill is an overreach and questioned how police could enforce it.\n\"This proposed distracted driving law is not needed, since three statutes can be used when a distraction causes unsafe actions, like swerving or crossing a line,\" said Steve Carrellas, policy and government affairs director for the National Motorists Association state chapter. \"There is unsafe driving, careless driving and reckless driving.\"\nSupporters of the bill must come to terms with the fact that a certain level of multitasking by drivers is a reality, Carrellas said.\n\"Would [the bill] make changing the radio station or adjusting the volume illegal? What about talking to a passenger?\" Carrellas asked.\nArnold Anderson, the Essex County Community Traffic Safety Program coordinator, said its imperative that motorists break the habit of doing more than one thing while driving.\n\"You've got to get people out of the mindset of multitasking,\" said Arnold Anderson, \" You can't multitask. We are so far away from the mindset of ... just drive.\"\nThis kills more drivers than anything else\nOfficials from AAA said that a distraction law would be hard to enforce since an officer would have to observe how the driver was distracted, but also that the bill may have a higher purpose.\n\"The legislation introduced by Assemblyman Wisniewski, while admirable in theory, may not help police enforce the law,\" said Tracy Noble, AAA Mid-Atlantic spokeswoman.\n\nBut a distraction law could have a similar effect as seat belt laws, which Noble and Anderson credited for increasing seat belt use in the state, even without fines.\n\n\"The more widespread the message of eliminating distractions becomes, the more likely it is to be ingrained in everyday behavior, similar to seat belt usage,\" Noble said.\nCurrently, New Jersey has laws banning the use of hand-held cell phones and texting while driving, but no prohibitions of other behavior that is considered distracting, according to the state Division of Highway Traffic Safety.\nLarry Higgs may be reached at lhiggs@njadvancemedia.com .

My family has decided to move to Santa Cruz. After many years of trying to make it work in Palo Alto, my husband and I cannot see a way to stay in Palo Alto and raise a family here. We rent our current home with another couple for $6200 a month; if we wanted to buy the same home and share it with children and not roommates, it would cost $2.7M and our monthly payment would be $12,177 a month in mortgage, taxes, and insurance. That's $146,127 per year - an entire professional's income before taxes. This is unaffordable even for an attorney and a software engineer.\nIt's clear that if professionals like me cannot raise a family here, then all of our teachers, first responders, and service workers are in dire straits. We already see openings at our police department that we can't fill and numerous teacher contracts that we can't renew because the cost of housing is astronomical not just in Palo Alto but many miles in each direction. I have repeatedly made recommendations to the Council to expand the housing supply in Palo Alto so that together with our neighboring cities who are already adding housing, we can start to make a dent in the jobs-housing imbalance that causes housing prices throughout the Bay Area to spiral out of control. Small steps like allowing 2 floors of housing instead of 1 in mixed use developments, enforcing minimum density requirements so that developers build apartments instead of penthouses, legalizing duplexes, easing restrictions on granny units, leveraging the residential parking permit program to experiment with housing for people who don't want or need two cars, and allowing single-use areas like the Stanford shopping center to add housing on top of shops (or offices), would go a long way in adding desperately needed housing units while maintaining the character of our neighborhoods and preserving historic structures throughout.\nTime and again, I've seen dozens of people come to both Commission meetings and Council meetings asking Council to make housing its top priority. The City Council received over 1000 signatures from Palo Alto residents asking for the same. In the annual Our Palo Alto survey, it is the top issue cited by residents. This Council has ignored the majority of residents and has charted a course for the next 15 years of this city's development which substantially continues the same job-housing imbalance this community has been suffering from for some time now: more offices, a nominal amount of housing which the Council is already laying the groundwork to tax out of existence, lip service to preserving retail that simply has no reason to keep serving the average Joe when the city is only affordable to Joe Millionaires.\nOver the last 5 years I've seen dozens of my friends leave Palo Alto and often leave the Bay Area entirely. I've seen friends from other states get job offers here and then turn them down when they started to look at the price of housing. I struggle to think what Palo Alto will become and what it will represent when young families have no hope of ever putting down roots here, and meanwhile the community is engulfed with middle-aged jet-setting executives and investors who are hardly the sort to be personally volunteering for neighborhood block parties, earthquake preparedness responsibilities, or neighborhood watch. If things keep going as they are, yes, Palo Alto's streets will look just as they did decades ago, but its inhabitants, spirit, and sense of community will be unrecognizable. A once thriving city will turn into a hollowed out museum. We should take care to remember that Palo Alto is famous the world over for its residents' accomplishments, but none of those people would be able to live in Palo Alto were they starting out today.\nSincerely,\nKate Downing\nUPDATE: Thank you so much for the outpouring of interest and support. While we are leaving Palo Alto, the organization I co-founded that is working to invest in housing and transportation will continue on its work so that maybe in the future we can have a more inclusive community. If you'd like to learn more, go here.\nIf you'd like to look into the belly of the beast, read the comments on our local paper: Palo Alto Online. The loudest voices in the community feel that the desire to create more affordable housing is spoiled entitlement. Until renters, younger people, and people of more modest means organize, this problem will continue throughout the Bay Area.

In the annual Our Palo Alto survey, it is the top issue cited by residents.\n\"This council has ignored the majority of residents and has chartered a course for the next 15 years of this city's development, which substantially continues the same job-housing imbalance this community has been suffering from for some time now: more offices, a nominal amount of housing, which the Council is already laying the groundwork to tax out of existence, lip service to preserving retail that simply has no reason to keep serving the average Joe when the city is only available to Joe Millionaires.\"\nIn her resignation letter, Downing pointed to the city's difficulties in filling job openings in the Palo Alto Police Department and renewing contracts with the local teachers because of the \"astronomical\" cost of housing, not just in Palo Alto but \"many miles in each direction.\"\nIt is clear, she wrote, that \"if professionals like me cannot raise a family here, then all of our teachers, first responders, and service workers are in dire straits.\"\nDowning herself is facing similar challenges, despite the fact that she is a corporate attorney and her husband is a software engineer at Palantir. For several years, they have been renting a home in the Ventura neighborhood. Now, they are preparing to move to Santa Cruz.\nIn her resignation letter, Downing wrote that \"After many years of trying to make it work in Palo Alto, my husband and I cannot see a way to stay in Palo Alto and raise a family here.\"\n\"We rent our current home with another couple for $6,200 a month; if we wanted to buy the same home and share it with children and not roommates, it would cost $2.7M and our monthly payment would be $12,177 a month in mortgage, taxes and insurance,\" Downing wrote. \"That's $146,127 per year -- an entire professional's income before taxes. This is unaffordable even for an attorney and a software engineer.\"\nDowning also noted that over the last five years, she'd seen dozens of her friends leave Palo Alto and, in some cases, the Bay Area. She also said that she has seen friends from other states get job offers in Palo Alto and then turn them down whey they started to look at the price of housing.\n\"I struggle to think what Palo Alto will become and what it will represent when young families have no hope of ever putting down roots here, and meanwhile the community is engulfed with middle-aged jet-setting executives and investors who are hardly the sort to be personally volunteering for neighborhood block parties, earthquake preparedness responsibilities, or neighborhood watch,\" Downing wrote. \"If things keep going as they are, yes, Palo Alto's streets will look just as they did decades ago, but its inhabitants, spirit, and sense of community will be unrecognizable.\n\"A once thriving city will turn into a hollowed out museum. We should take care to remember that Palo Alto is famous the world over for its residents' accomplishments, but none of those people would be able to live in Palo Alto were they starting out today,\" she wrote.\nDowning is hardly alone in urging the council to act with more urgency on promoting affordable housing. In March, more than 1,000 residents, including numerous former mayors and planning commissioners, signed a petition spearheaded by Palo Alto Forward that urged the council to do more to address this topic.\n\"The cost of living in Palo Alto has skyrocketed. As a result, we are seeing long-time neighbors move because they can no longer afford the rent,\" the petition stated. \"It is not unusual for Palo Alto workers to commute in from areas as far as Stockton, Gilroy and Tracy, putting severe strain on our roads and our climate. We are on the path to being a city composed only of long-time landowners and wealthy newcomers. This situation is the result of city policies that have discouraged new housing while encouraging more office space.\"\nRecent surveys also suggest that residents are growing increasingly anxious about getting priced out of Palo Alto. In the city's annual survey, the number of people who gave Palo Alto good grades for \"variety of housing options\" dropped from 27 percent in 2014 to 20 percent in 2015, while the percentage of people who ranked the city as a good or excellent place to retire dropped from 60 percent to 52 percent between 2014 and 2015 (in 2006, it was 68 percent).\nLocal concerns about housing were also highlighted in a poll that the city commissioned last spring, when it was considering whether to proceed with a business tax to address traffic congestion. The poll showed 76 percent of the respondents listing \"cost of housing\" as an \"extremely serious\" or \"very serious\" problem, a higher percentage than any other issue (the drought and traffic congestion scored second and third, with 65 percent and 53 percent, respectively).\nDowning's letter comes at a particularly sensitive time for local politics. The city is about to hold its first City Council election since the slow-growth \"residentialist\" camp won the council majority in 2014 and four of the council's nine seats will be up for grabs.\nSeveral candidates jumping into the race, including current planning commission Chair Adrian Fine, Human Relations Commission Chair Greer Stone and technology executive Michelle Kraus (all of whom are renters) have vowed to make creation of more housing options a priority if elected.\n---\nFollow the Palo Alto Weekly/Palo Alto Online on Twitter @PaloAltoWeekly and Facebook for breaking news, local events, photos, videos and more. ", " PALO ALTO -- You're a well-paid professional. You work in tech. You've got it made.\nNot if you want to buy a house in Silicon Valley.\nOn Wednesday, a planning commissioner here became the very public voice of the region's frustrations over spiraling housing costs when she published her resignation letter to the city of Palo Alto. It said that she and her husband are moving to Santa Cruz because -- even with their combined incomes as a tech lawyer and software engineer -- they can't afford to live in this upscale city.\nAfter five years of \"trying to make it work in Palo Alto, my husband and I cannot see a way to stay in Palo Alto and raise a family here,\" Planning and Transportation Commissioner Kate Downing wrote in her public resignation letter.\nThe letter makes personal what the numbers show: That rising rents and home prices of recent years have put the region beyond the reach of many, even some at the top of the heap -- including in the lucrative tech industry that fuels the rush for housing.\nThe average rent in Palo Alto was $3,463 in the second quarter of 2016, according to a report last month from Novato-based RealFacts. In June, the median price of a single-family home was $1.2 million in San Mateo County and $982,500 in Santa Clara County, according to the CoreLogic real estate information service.\nDowning, 31, has a full-time job as senior corporate counsel to a tech company in Santa Clara. In an interview, she explained that her letter \"is not supposed to be a sad story about me. I'm going to land on my feet. I'm extraordinarily lucky and privileged. I'm going to be fine.\"\nAdvertisement\nRather, she characterized the letter as a warning call about economic trends and failed policies that are hurting Palo Alto and the region. \"It's clear,\" she wrote, \"that if professionals like me cannot raise a family here, then all of our teachers, first responders and service workers are in dire straits.\"\nDowning and her engineer husband, Steve Downing, 33, share a 2,300-square-foot, four-bedroom house in Palo Alto's Ventura neighborhood with another couple. The monthly rent is $6,200.\n\"That's actually pretty cheap for here,\" she said in the interview. \"We probably pay on the low end of what they could get for our home.\"\nHer letter calculated that if the couple \"wanted to buy the same home and share it with children and not roommates, it would cost $2.7 million, and our monthly payment would be $12,177 a month in mortgage, taxes and insurance. That's $146,127 per year -- an entire professional's income before taxes. This is unaffordable even for an attorney and a software engineer.\"\nThe Downings based those numbers on putting 20 percent down: \"If you put down less than that, you're not going to get picked,\" she said. \"Everyone knows how competitive it is in Palo Alto, with multiple offers on every house. Some of them are putting down all cash. They're coming in with just gigantic deposits.\"\nDowning's letter, a colleague said, is a timely commentary on Palo Alto's changing demographics: \"All of us who are in our 20s and 30 and 40s -- we're used to seeing people leave,\" said Elaine Uang, a co-founder with Downing of the community group Palo Alto Forward.\n\"You never know when your friends are going to go because there aren't the right housing options here for them to pursue the next stage of life.\"\nA commissioner since November 2014, Downing said in the letter that the city has failed to move the dial on housing. Stating that her own recommendations to the City Council have gone nowhere, she outlined some of the ways in which the housing supply might be expanded in order to \"make a dent in the jobs-housing imbalance that causes housing prices throughout the Bay Area to spiral out of control.\"\nShe mentioned \"small steps like allowing two floors of housing instead of one in mixed-used developments,\" as well as legalizing duplexes, streamlining restrictions on granny units and \"enforcing minimum-density requirements\" so that developers will \"build apartments instead of penthouses.\" Housing should be allowed, she wrote, above shops and offices in single-use areas like the Stanford Shopping Center.\n\"Kate does a good job summarizing the challenges we're facing as a community,\" said Councilman Cory Wolbach. \"To say that Palo Alto has been slow to add housing is a very accurate statement.\n\"There's nothing shocking here,\" he added, in regard to Downing's letter. \"Palo Alto certainly does not encourage high-density, smaller, more reasonably priced units. It's unfortunate but true.\"\nPalo Alto \"is not the family-oriented community it used to be,\" Downing said. In her estimation, it's becoming a place for \"jet-setting executives and investors\" who have neither the time or inclination to help out with block parties or join Neighborhood Watch.\n\"Young people are not moving here anymore. It used to be a place of innovation, where people created art and sculpture in their backyards or started companies in their garages. Now, it's more for people who are CEOs and executive vice presidents.\"\nContact Richard Scheinin at 408-920-5069, read his stories at www.mercurynews.com/richard-scheinin and follow him at Twitter.com/RealEstateRag. ", " In what's becoming a regular story in the Bay Area, many Peninsula towns' refusal to increase housing has led to a mass exit of long-time, working-class residents. First responders, police, teachers, grocery store clerks-the list goes on.\nThese small cities, rich with tech money and close-proximity desirability, have left it to San Francisco, Oakland, and only a few other areas to house the influx of new-moneyed arrivals.\nAnd with that, another noteworthy exodus has taken place: Palo Alto Planning and Transportation commissioner Kate Vershov Downing and her family have decided to leave the pricey town for Santa Cruz because they, like many other residents, can no longer afford the area.\nIn a letter of resignation, she starts off saying:\nDear City Council Members and Palo Alto Residents, This letter serves as my official resignation from the Planning and Transportation Commission. My family has decided to move to Santa Cruz. After many years of trying to make it work in Palo Alto, my husband and I cannot see a way to stay in Palo Alto and raise a family here. We rent our current home with another couple for $6200 a month; if we wanted to buy the same home and share it with children and not roommates, it would cost $2.7M and our monthly payment would be $12,177 a month in mortgage, taxes, and insurance. That's $146,127 per year - an entire professional's income before taxes. This is unaffordable even for an attorney and a software engineer.\nDowning goes on to note that the city council is, in part, to blame for this mess, noting that pleas from citizenry for more housing go ignored.\nI have repeatedly made recommendations to the Council to expand the housing supply in Palo Alto so that together with our neighboring cities who are already adding housing, we can start to make a dent in the jobs-housing imbalance that causes housing prices throughout the Bay Area to spiral out of control. Small steps like allowing 2 floors of housing instead of 1 in mixed use developments, enforcing minimum density requirements so that developers build apartments instead of penthouses, legalizing duplexes, easing restrictions on granny units, leveraging the residential parking permit program to experiment with housing for people who don't want or need two cars, and allowing single-use areas like the Stanford shopping center to add housing on top of shops (or offices), would go a long way in adding desperately needed housing units while maintaining the character of our neighborhoods and preserving historic structures throughout. Time and again, I've seen dozens of people come to both Commission meetings and Council meetings asking Council to make housing its top priority. The City Council received over 1000 signatures from Palo Alto residents asking for the same. In the annual Our Palo Alto survey, it is the top issue cited by residents. This Council has ignored the majority of residents and has chartered a course for the next 15 years of this city's development which substantially continues the same job-housing imbalance this community has been suffering from for some time now: more offices, a nominal amount of housing which the Council is already laying the groundwork to tax out of existence, lip service to preserving retail that simply has no reason to keep serving the average Joe when the city is only affordable to Joe Millionaires.\nLike Menlo Park, Palo Alto's housing stock is extremely pricey. You can hardly find a home on the market right now for less than $1 million.

Or maybe, upon close inspection of the footage, perhaps she just missed grabbing his outstretched hand, like a trapeze artist flubbing the catch.\nRebuffed, POTUS smooths his tie.\nThe couple's efforts at hand-holding have long fascinated White House watchers. (\"Donald Trump 'avoids holding Melania's hand in public because he wants to look like a presidential alpha,' says body language expert,\" was the headline of a Daily Mail story from February.) Others tagged videos of the botched attempt at hand-holding with the hashtag #FreeMelania.\nThis latest bit of awkwardness, even if it was just a meaningless goof, is likely to just give such narratives, uh, legs. ", " There was no husband-wife hand-holding as President Donald Trump and his wife, First Lady Melania Trump, arrived Tel Aviv, Israel, on Monday, the second stop on their eight-day tour to five countries.\nAs the Trumps walked away from Air Force One on the Israeli tarmac, the president was seen reaching for his wife's hand. She then appeared to be swatting the president's hand away. Israeli newspaper Haaretz shared a clip of the moment on Twitter, and it has since gone viral.\nIlia Yefimovich/Getty Images\nThe moment comes not long after the first lady's verified personal Twitter account liked a tweet about her dramatic change in facial expressions at the inauguration when she smiled, then scowled, after the president glanced in her direction. In his anti-Trump tweet, writer Andy Ostroy joked: \"Seems the only #Wall @realDonaldTrump's built is the one between him and @FLOTUS #Melania #trump.\"\nThe tweet was un-liked after Twitter caught on, and Melania's communications director, Stephanie Grisham, later told PEOPLE \"The First Lady wasn't aware of any of this until I brought it to her attention. It isn't her primary account and we have since changed the passwords.\"\nRELATED VIDEO: Exclusive: Natasha Stoynoff Speaks Out: 'I Don't Want Women to Feel Afraid'\nJust ahead of the president's overseas tour - his first foreign trip as president - the first lady announced her plans to join.\n\"I am very excited for the upcoming trip,\" the first lady said in a statement. \"This will not just be an opportunity to support my husband as he works on important matters of national security and foreign relations, it will also be my honor to visit and speak with women and children from different countries, with different perspectives.\"\nAfter arriving in Israel, Monday, Trump became the first president to visit the Western Wall, reported CNN.\nThe first lady and Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, also prayed at the wall.

", " Maybe Melania Trump, a woman who was once photographed for Vanity Fair forking a bowl of expensive necklaces as though they were spaghetti noodles, has more in common with the average American than we initially thought. Like the average American, it appears that she too, cannot stand her husband.\nThis afternoon in Tel Aviv, President Donald Trump reached for his wife's hand. Rather than indulge him with human touch, the sort of human touch regular married people who like each other might engage in, the reluctant First Lady swatted his hand away. This wasn't done backstage before an event, or in the privacy of a place where it was safe to assume there weren't any cameras. No, Melania has grown bolder in her push to telegraph her disdain for Donald. She did it as she and her husband joined Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife in a photo op. She did it in front of a veritable United Nations of news cameras. She did it so the whole world could see. She doesn't care if he's embarrassed, and it completely rules.\nAnd the whole world did see; within minutes, the moment had gone viral. With that swat, Melania had temporarily sated the public's bottomless appetite to see President Trump denied what he wants in its most viscerally appealing manifestation. Trump wanted his wife to accept him, to join him in acting like a normal human couple for the cameras instead of an orb-fondling wannabe despot. Seeing tweets about a judge striking down an immigration ban, or watching a Trump surrogate make an ass of themselves on cable news just doesn't taste as delicious to a victory-starved liberal as the image of a woman slapping Trump's hand away. For the millions who continue to be horrified by the Trump era, there's nothing more zeitgeisty in 2017 than Trump schadenfreude porn. And there's nobody more well-positioned to deliver it than our Ice Queen First Lady.\nThis isn't the first time Melania has denied Donald's undersized hands the pleasure of human touch. In January, when the couple arrived in Washington for his inauguration, Donald tried to hold his wife's hand just before completing the very scary task of going down a flight of stairs. Melania was not having it.\nThat move kicked off an inauguration weekend that, told from Melania's perspective, would read like a novel about a tragically trapped princess, or a live-action Pepe Le Pew cartoon starring Melania as the cat. When the couple danced, Melania leaned away rigidly. In every public appearance, the impeccably dressed First Lady wore a veil of despair. Her husband often seemed to forget that she existed. When they kissed, they did not touch. Melania acted like a mascot of left-wing despair.\nIn the ensuing weeks, Melania's public disdain for her husband only intensified. An US Weekly cover story declared that she was \"secretly miserable\" as First Lady, an account I must dispute since it's always been obvious that she's miserable. She skipped out on typical first lady duties when the prime minister of Japan visited. And a couple of weeks ago, whoever manages her verified Twitter account favorited a Tweet about how alienated the Trumps seem from each other.\nAll of this is occurring as Trump's daughter Ivanka performs most of the non-romantic duties of First Lady, delivering speeches and posing for photos. In recent interviews, Ivanka's even started putting on a strange Jackie O affect. If I were Melania, I'd find the whole thing irksome.\nCritics will point out that Melania, of course, is no hero, and no saint. She's the one who married Donald, and she can leave whenever she gets sick of living in a golden box in the sky and feeling sorry for herself. There are plenty of women whose lives are much more worse off thanks to the president, and plenty more whose lives would be worse off if not for the saving grace of checks and balances. But her public acting out provides a nice bit of levity for a time that often feels devoid of it; a lot of women would love the opportunity to swat Trump's hand away.\nMelania's swats also serve to expose another Trump lie: when you're a star, they don't always let you do it."], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "665, 672;751, 820", "docSpanText": "Melania<SPAN_SEP>she seemed startled when Donald walked behind her and touched her arm"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "995, 1149", "docSpanText": "In the very moment her husband makes contact with her, she quickly turns her head and takes a deep breath before making eye contact with the cameras again"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "120, 200", "docSpanText": "you can't deny the fact Melania Trump looks miserable being America's first lady"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "202, 313", "docSpanText": "Various photos have provided obvious evidence that Donald Trump's wife hasn't been happy with her new lifestyle"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "665, 672;755, 820", "docSpanText": "Melania<SPAN_SEP>seemed startled when Donald walked behind her and touched her arm"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1428, 1475", "docSpanText": "The \"flinch\" sparked curiosity in Twitter users"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "751, 820", "docSpanText": "she seemed startled when Donald walked behind her and touched her arm"}, {"documentFile": "3.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "270, 381", "docSpanText": "the president was seen reaching for his wife's hand.

That has triggered lots of coverage along these lines in the Daily News: She \"refused to hold her husband's hand and then slapped it away.\" A post at the Daily Beast raises the ante on that sentiment. But many also were taking a more middle-ground approach, hedging descriptions of Melania's action with phrases like \"appeared to be swatting\" (People) or \"seems to swat away\" (Los Angeles Times). The Washington Post, meanwhile, offered one of the most charitable explanations: \"Or maybe, upon close inspection of the footage, perhaps she just missed grabbing his outstretched hand, like a trapeze artist flubbing the catch,\" writes Emily Heil.

Researchers have found a way to turn used coffee grounds into an alcoholic beverage. In recent years, the industry of distilled spirits has put out a call for new beverages with different flavors created from unusual raw materials. To answer this call, some scientists examined the potential of used coffee grounds. The scientists first collected this raw material from a Portuguese coffee roasting company and dried it. Then they heated the powder in water at 163degC for 45 minutes, separated out the liquid, and added sugar. Next, the team mixed in yeast cells, let the concoction ferment, and concentrated the sample to get a higher alcohol content. (A similar process is used to produce other distilled beverages such as whiskey and rum from wheat and molasses.) And voila! Used coffee grounds produced a new alcoholic beverage with 40% ethanol, comparable to other hard liquor such as vodka and tequila, researchers will report in the September issue of LWT - Food Science and Technology. To evaluate the product, eight trained taste testers were brought in and rated the intensity of different smells and flavors in the alcohol. The judges described the drink as smelling like coffee and tasting bitter and pungent. Researchers noted that the taste could be improved with age and concluded that the quality was good enough for consumption. Don't count on the caffeine to keep you awake, however; most of it disappears in the brewing process. ", " Whiskey, vodka, gin or rum...or tequila or brandy...made from wheat, barley, corn, potatoes, rye, sugarcane or any number of fruits-whatever the booze, Americans, the dominant drinkers of hard liquor worldwide, will go for it. But America's love of hootch pales in comparison to its love of another drink: coffee. A new process that ferments liquor from used coffee grounds, then, may be just what the country is after.\nReporting on a new study for Science, Nisha Giridharan details how to make what could soon be your new favorite drink:\nThe scientists first collected from a Portuguese coffee roasting company and dried it.

So that was the problem.\"\nBarbour said he is glad Medlin had a cell phone nearby to text the woman, but believes all 911 centers should be able to be updated so that they can initiate texts from their systems.\nMattevi was charged with false imprisonment. He was released on a $10,000 bond. ", " A 911 dispatcher for Johnston County, North Carolina, recently helped save a woman who was locked in the trunk of a moving car, according to officials.\nThe 29-year-old woman called 911 around 4 a.m. on Jan. 14, 2017, saying she had a disagreement with her boyfriend, who forced her into a trunk, Jason Barbour, director of the Johnston County Emergency 911 Communications Center, said.\nBarbour told ABC News today that the shift supervisor at the time, Tim Medlin, responded to the call.\n\"She was crying and very upset, so it was hard to understand her at first, but [Medlin] finally heard her say she was locked in a trunk of a car,\" Barbour explained. \"The call then dropped, and his multiple attempts to call her back were unsuccessful.\"\nMedlin \"refused to give up\" and used the office's emergency cellphone in an attempt to reach the woman, according to Barbour.\n\"It was this flip phone, and [Medlin] texted the woman on that phone since he couldn't reach her by calling,\" Barbour said. \"Fortunately, she started texting back and told us that she needed help and that she believed she was in a red Mustang headed towards Fayetteville.\"\nMedlin was then able to get the woman's location with the help of a cellphone provider. Police responded and stopped the car in the city of Fayetteville, Barbour said.\n\"And lo and behold, the woman was in the trunk of the car,\" Barbour said. He added that if it wasn't for Medlin's quick thinking, the woman may not have been found on time.\n\"He really stood by our motto, 'Failure is not an option,'\" Barbour said.\nLt. Todd Joyce, a public information officer for the Fayetteville Police Department, told ABC News today that the woman in the trunk was found unharmed. He added that her boyfriend, 32-year-old Nicholas Mattevi, was arrested around 5 a.m. and charged with false imprisonment, a misdemeanor.\nFayetteville Police Department\nMattevi has since been released from jail, according to Joyce. He said it was not immediately clear if Mattevi had obtained a lawyer or entered a plea.\nABC News could not reach Mattevi for comment.\nThe Cumberland County District Court did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for information. ", " A 911 dispatcher's quick thinking may have saved a life or prevented a more serious crime. It happened in Johnston County as a woman was locked in the trunk of car going down the interstate.Around 4 a.m. Saturday, January 14, Johnston County 911 Shift Supervisor Tim Medlin got a 911 cell phone call from a woman who said she'd been kidnapped from Raleigh and put in the trunk of a car which was traveling down the highway.At that point, the car was headed east on I-40 nearing the I-95 interchange. Dispatchers had that information from a cell phone tracking device. But, the caller wasn't able to tell dispatchers anything else valuable before the call was lost.She didn't answer when they called back. That's when Medlin had an idea. Dispatchers had a cell phone to notify supervisors if the land lines went out. He decided to use it to text the woman who called.She responded, told them she knew the man driving, and were likely headed to Fayetteville. Dispatchers sent Fayetteville police to the address. They arrested Nicholas Mattevi and charged him with false imprisonment.There was huge sigh of relief in the Johnston County 911 center.\"Okay, they're out with her. They've got them. They've confirmed that they've got them. We're like, 'Okay, this is over with. It's done. I can go home. I can go to bed. We've done our job,'\" Medlin recalled.The phone that Medlin used is an old flip phone.

Some issue stern pre-show warnings that anyone caught texting or talking will be shown the door.\nIt's not surprising then that the new chief executive and president of AMC Theaters, Adam M. Aron, caused a stir by suggesting that nation's second-largest movie theater company would consider the idea of making certain auditoriums \"more texting friendly\" in a bid to get millennials to go to the movies more often.\n\"When you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone, don't ruin the movie, they hear please cut off your left arm above the elbow,\" said Aron in an interview with Variety published online Wednesday.\n\"You can't tell a 22-year-old to turn off their cellphone. That's not how they live,\" said Aron, who hailed from outside the movie business before taking the reins of parent company AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) in January.\nHis suggestion that the company might revisit its stance on texting during shows didn't sit well with many movie buffs, who flooded AMC's social media accounts with objections. Some threatened to take their business elsewhere if AMC followed through with the idea.\nThe company quickly responded to the backlash with the following post: \"Press reports we are considering test allowing texts in a very few screens. We know vast majority of audience wants no texting. If ever, we only would pursue this in a way that we can be totally confident ALL our guests will fully enjoy the movie-going experience at AMC.\"\nThat still wasn't enough to quell critics on Twitter and Facebook. By Friday, AMC retreated with a company statement that included the following tweet:\nNO TEXTING AT AMC. Won't happen. You spoke. We listened. Quickly, that idea has been sent to the cutting room floor. pic.twitter.com/JR0fo5megR - AMC Theatres (@AMCTheatres) April 15, 2016\nAron, former CEO of Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT), is no doubt mulling new ways for AMC to woo an increasingly distracted and demanding audience. Rather than turn off their smartphones, many millennials would rather skip the theater altogether, or kick back at home and stream movies on their flat-screen TVs or mobile devices, via Netflix (NFLX) and other services.\nIn 2015, America's 18- to 24-year olds represented 10 percent of the U.S. population and bought 14 percent of all movie tickets sold here, down from 16 percent in 2014, according to Stan Meyers, a Piper Jaffray & Co. analyst who covers media and entertainment companies.\nTeens, somewhat surprisingly, are going to the movies more often these days, as are those in the 60-plus set, as measured by their percentage contributions to overall ticket sales between 2014 and 2015, said Meyers.\n\"One of the things keeping millennials away from the movies is that they need to be on their phones all the time. What [Adam Aron] wants to do is segregate different groups so that people don't want to be on their phones, i.e., older demographic groups, and those who do could be in different [auditoriums],\" said Meyers.\nIn his first few months as CEO, Aron has taken other steps to ensure that AMC, known as an innovator in the movie business, stays competitive in the face of demographic shifts and rapid technological change. In March, AMC announced that it has struck a deal to acquire Carmike Cinemas (CKEC), a merger that would create the world's largest chain of movie theaters.\nAMC, a subsidiary of Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group, is also reportedly close to a deal with the Screening Room, a startup that will offer new releases in the home, via a set-top box that transmits movies, for $50 per view, according to Variety.\nThe venture is controversial within the movie business, but Variety reports that the Screening Room, backed by Sean Parker of Facebook (FB) and Napster fame, is seeking to pave its way by sharing its proceeds with distributors and providing customers with two free movie tickets per view, which would help boost concession sales for theater operators.\nBut it's the texting controversy that has put AMC in the hot seat in the eyes of some moviegoers. That is perhaps not surprising given that some people feel so strongly about the etiquette surrounding cell phone use in theaters that the issue has sparked violence. In early 2014 an argument between two men in a theater in Wesley Chapel, Florida, over texting ended in a fatal shooting. Before the argument erupted, the man who was eventually shot was sending text messages to his daughter during the previews to the movie. ", " Tweet with a location\nYou can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications. You always have the option to delete your Tweet location history. Learn more ", " Adam Aron has been head of AMC Entertainment for less than four months, but in that short time he's already orchestrated one of the most significant deals in the country's history. In February, AMC announced that it has an agreement to buy Carmike, propelling it from being the second-biggest exhibitor in the country to the world's top movie theater chain.\nAron has a diverse resume, having been head of Starwood Hotels and Resorts, CEO and co-owner of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team, chairman and CEO of Vail Resorts and president and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line. But in an industry dominated by lifers, he is a newcomer to the exhibition space.\nThat's giving him a willingness to experiment. He's pushing to expand AMC's food options, bolster its loyalty program and market more aggressively. Some moves may ruffle feathers. In a bid to attract younger, smartphone savvy consumers, Aron said he was open to making some theaters texting and mobile device-friendly.\nThat may make him unpopular. When Regal Entertainment CEO Amy Miles mused in 2012 that theaters should consider experimenting with relaxing cellphone bans, the blowback was intense.\nRelated Movie Tickets in London Hit $50 - Here's What They Cost Around the World 'The Terror' Season 2 Adds George Takei as Series Regular, Consultant\nAron sat down with Variety during CinemaCon, the annual exhibition trade show unfolding this week in Las Vegas, to discuss the planned merger with Carmike, ticketing advances and Screening Room, the controversial start-up that wants to debut movies in the home the same day they hit theaters.\nYou've worked in a number of different industries, but you're new to exhibition. What perspective do you bring?\nComing in fresh, it seems like there's lots of opportunity to propel revenues or to give consumers better experiences. AMC has been a leader in that regard for a few years now, but I think we will pick up even more of a reputation for that going forward. Already, having been here a couple of months, I know we can step up our marketing activity in a big way. The food that we serve in our theaters can be much more exciting than the current stable of chicken tenders, hot dogs, pizza, in addition to the standard soda and popcorn and candy. A lot of change is possible in this industry for the betterment of our shareholders and our customers.\nMarketing costs money. Why do you think it's worth the expense?\nNext year, assuming the Carmike acquisition is consummated, AMC is going to have in the neighborhood of $4 billion worth of revenue. It's almost irresponsible for a company with $4 billion worth of revenue on the line not to aggressively market. That's one of the things that can ensure that the $4 billion comes in, and that's one of the things that can ensure that more than $4 billion comes in. We wouldn't be spending for additional marketing if we didn't think we'd be driving big revenue gains.\nAre there particular demographics that you plan to target with your marketing?\nWe ought to be looking at three things. People who are already interested in movies and maybe in a big way, where if we up our game, we could get them to come to more movies. That's one of the reasons to have a better loyalty program with bigger, broader participation, because loyalty programs work. We can convince people who think they are seeing the most movies they can possibly see to go to more movies.\nThe second is market share we can take from our competitors if we market AMC better than they market their theaters.\nAnd third, there does seem to be a consensus that there are pockets of consumers who do not see as many movies as other segments of the population and that we can be doing more to attract those people. Millennials come to mind. We need to reshape our product in some concrete ways so that millennials go to movie theaters with the same degree of intensity as baby boomers went to movie theaters throughout their lives.\nWould appealing to millennials involve allowing texting or cellphone use?\nYes. When you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone, don't ruin the movie, they hear please cut off your left arm above the elbow. You can't tell a 22-year-old to turn off their cellphone. That's not how they live their life.\nAt the same time, though, we're going to have to figure out a way to do it that doesn't disturb today's audiences. There's a reason there are ads up there saying turn off your phone, because today's moviegoer doesn't want somebody sitting next to them texting or having their phone on.\nWould you have a certain section for texting?\nThat's one possibility. What may be more likely is we take specific auditoriums and make them more texting friendly.\nThere are reports that you have signed a letter of intent to partner with Screening Room. What is your position on the company?\nI'm not commenting publicly on Screening Room. I know it's a topic of hot debate amongst my brethren and sister-en, and I prefer to keep our counsel private right now. Until such time as Screening Room is real, we don't have to spend a lot of time talking about it publicly.\nHow open are you to different distribution strategies that might modify the theatrical window?\nFor all the talk of the Paramount test a year ago [Editor's note: AMC signed a deal that allowed the studio to debut two films on home entertainment early] and all the talk of Screening Room now, you may be surprised to hear that I think windows are very important. There's a lot of evidence that shorter windows put theatrical exhibitors at risk. Studios themselves benefit from posting big global box office numbers, which comes from theatrical distribution.\nSo I start from a general premise that I'm a big fan of windows. Having said that, I'm also a big fan of experimenting and testing on everything that we do to see if there aren't alternative ways of doing business. I generally look at our 385 theaters as laboratories where we can test lots of different concepts without being afraid that there's going to be a cataclysmic, sky's falling in, if we do. I believe in innovation and being imaginative and forward thinking. There are some bedrock principles though.\nWhat are those bedrock principles?\nI have two bedrock principles and only two bedrock principles. One is that it's our burden as managers of the company that runs movie theaters to make sure that the moviegoing experience is as wonderful and spectacular as it possibly can be. The surest way to grow our business and protect it against erosion is to make sure that going to an AMC theater is a pleasing and memorable experience.\nThe second is the consumer is king. Giving the consumer more choices, more amenities and price points. If we put ourselves in the head of our customer and design our theatrical experience and marketing activity to make their lives better, we'll have a successful company. Other than that we'll be flexible and willing to experiment.\nWhere are you in terms of closing the Carmike acquisition?\nThere are really only two hurdles to go through. Carmike's shareholders have to vote to approve the transaction. I expect that's going to be some time in June. I don't think they've set a date.\nWe need to get through the Justice Department approval, but we're optimistic that we will get through both of these hurdles. The contract we have with Carmike requires that we get through this a year from the date of the merger transaction, so early in the first quarter of 2017. It would be nice if we could get it done before that.\nWhat does the merger do for AMC?\nBy putting together the No. 2 and No. 4 players in the industry, we create a new No. 1 player. There's extraordinary amounts of research that say that No. 1 players in industries are often the most successful players in their industries. If that turns out to be true, I'd rather be the No. 1 player than the No. 2 player.\nWhy did you recently sign a deal with ticketing app, Atom Tickets?\nThey've got a great social media platform where when you buy a ticket for a Wednesday night at 7:00 show, it sends a text message to all your friends asking if they want to go to the theater and sit next to you. They click a couple of buttons and your friend can buy a ticket at the same theater and showtime in a reserved seat.

I will be contacting the FBI and the Justice Department,\" Scaramucci wrote, inexplicably tagging White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Scaramucci did not specify what information was leaked, but a Politico article cited the incoming communications director's required financial disclosure in reporting he earned $4.9 million since last year from his ownership stake in investment firm SkyBridge. Scaramucci appeared to delete the tweet, but in a subsequent post said Priebus was among the senior White House officials helping to crack down on leaks. ", " The incoming White House communications director earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in SkyBridge. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Scaramucci still stands to profit from SkyBridge from the White House The newly named White House communications director has earned millions from ownership stake since last year, according to his financial disclosure.\nAnthony Scaramucci finally has his White House job, but he still stands to profit from an ownership stake in his investment firm SkyBridge Capital.\nThe incoming White House communications director earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in SkyBridge in addition to more than $5 million in salary between Jan. 1, 2016, and the end of June, when he joined the Export-Import Bank, according to a financial disclosure filed with the Office of Government Ethics.\nStory Continued Below\nThe disclosure form, which is publicly available upon request, hasn't been previously reported.\nThe disclosure highlights the extensive wealth Scaramucci has accumulated in his career - much like many of Trump's other top advisers and Cabinet secretaries - and also the challenge he faces in extracting himself from the potential conflicts his investments could pose.\nScaramucci's financial filing values SkyBridge Capital at more than $50 million and states that he owns nearly 44 percent of the firm. When the sale of the company is completed, expected to be in the third quarter of this year, he will receive \"the agreed-upon purchase price for his share of the sale proceeds,\" according to the filing.\nBloomberg valued the Skybridge deal at between $200 million and $230 million when it was announced in January.\n\"It's black and white that he's going to get money,\" said Austin Evers, executive director at American Oversight, a watchdog group that focuses on transparency in government.\nThe SkyBridge website continues to advertise Scaramucci as the firm's managing director, despite the fact that he has been a government employee for more than a month. A SkyBridge spokeswoman said Scaramucci stepped down from the executive post Jan. 17, when the company's sale was announced. He remained an employee of the firm, collecting a salary, until starting at Ex-Im last month.\nThe investment firm, which Scaramucci founded in 2005, is in the process of being sold to RON Transatlantic and Chinese conglomerate HNA Group. The sale, set in motion in January when Scaramucci was shedding his holdings in anticipation of landing an administration job, has drawn the scrutiny of regulators and is taking longer than expected to close.\nThe interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is examining the deal to ensure that it carries no risk to national security. The panel's review, which comes amid ramped-up scrutiny of business dealings with China, ultimately can be overruled by President Donald Trump.\nScaramucci said Friday his start date wouldn't be until August so that everything can be \"100 percent totally cleansed and clean and I don't see an issue with it.\"\nWhite House spokeswoman Natalie Strom referred questions about Scaramucci's SkyBridge investment to the Treasury. Treasury spokeswoman Marisol Garibay did not respond to requests for comment.\nScaramucci, a Trump fundraiser and frequent campaign surrogate whose appointment to an administration post was delayed in part because of the complicated nature of the SkyBridge sale, joined Ex-Im in June.\nEx-Im was seen as a \"very temporary move,\" a way to get the Trump loyalist to Washington until a higher-level position could be found, according to one White House adviser.\nThe bank is across the street from the White House, where Scaramucci was free to come and go thanks to security credentials that gave him 24-hour access. That allowed him to elude the detection of senior White House staffers, including chief of staff Reince Priebus.\nScaramucci has been on unpaid leave from Ex-Im since the day he started there, June 19, a bank spokeswoman said, forgoing his $172,100 salary as chief strategy officer.\nA friend said Scaramucci thought his stay at the bank would be longer-lived and that the White House job came unexpectedly.\nIn his disclosure, Scaramucci listed assets worth as much as $85 million. He has several real estate investments, including single-family rental homes on Long Island.\nA minority stake in the New York Mets is worth as much as $5 million. He also is an investor in Juice Press, a chain of snack and smoothie shops in the Northeast.\nScaramucci earned $200,000 in income from a majority stake in Hastings Capital Group, according to his financial disclosure. That ownership share also will be sold as part of the SkyBridge deal with RON and HNA.\nAs a contributor to Fox News, Scaramucci earned about $88,000, according to his financial disclosure.\nHe has three mortgages with U.S. Bank for a total liability of $2.5 million to $7 million.\nJosh Dawsey contributed to this report.

According to Reddit administrators, photos of gymnast McKayla Maroney and MTV actress Liz Lee, shared to 130,000 people on popular forum r/TheFappening, constitute child pornography.\nMaroney's lawyers have confirmed that the illegally obtained photos were taken while the gymnast was underage. The attorneys' letter, sent to Porn.com and other websites, demands that the images be removed.\nAdditionally, Reddit users have been sharing revenge-porn photos of the actress Liz Lee, whose photos were not part of the initial leaks, but were taken and leaked by her boyfriend when Lee was 16.\nThe ongoing leak-dubbed #CelebGate, or more distastefully, \"the Fappening\"-includes naked photos of A-listers including Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton. It's prompted outrage, and threats of legal actions from the women targeted. It has since emerged that the photos of at least one of the celebrities were taken when they were under 18.\nThe Reddit community r/TheFappening has become the main hub for the leaked photos, due to the fact that Reddit is one of the few mainstream websites that isn't proactively deleting all links to them. In an urgent post, the subreddit's moderators warn the community that the site's admins have informed them that Maroney was underage in the photos \"and that we quickly need to remove them.\n\"If we don't remove them,\" moderator SickOrSane continues, \"this subreddit will most likely be banned, very quickly.\"\nThe moderator also warns against sharing Lee's photos, which are apparently also being posted on the subreddit.\n\n\n\n Redditors have immediately begun to panic, discussing the potential implications of their downloading and sharing child pornography.\n\n\n\n Despite the proliferation of child pornography across r/TheFappening-in addition to the stolen intimate photos of adult celebrities-the Reddit admins have chosen not to remove the community, apparently content to let the moderators sort it out instead.

(The linked photo in the screenshot below is not pornographic.)\nReddit admins may yet change course and decide to ban r/TheFappening. Even though redditors are using the site to instruct one another how to hide evidence of the child porn they downloaded via Reddit, administrators seem happy to allow the community to exist.\nIt still remains unclear how the photos were leaked, though Apple has strongly denied early reports that hackers gained access to them through a vulnerability in iCloud.\nPhoto via teuobk/Flickr (CC BY 2.0) | Remix by Fernando Alfonso III ", " The bizarre silver lining to this whole leaked celebrity nudes thing: a group of Redditors is so enamored with Jennifer Lawrence's naked body that they've donated thousands of dollars to the Prostate Cancer Foundation in her honor.\nYesterday, a post on r/TheFappening, a Reddit thread dedicated to, erm, discussing and cataloging the dozens of naked celebrity pictures that hit the internet over the weekend, urged readers to \"Be the hero TheFappening deserves\" by donating money to prostate cancer research, which, the joke goes, Lawrence has supported in the past.

But they couldn't be sure any of it was easing the peril at the tsunami-ravaged facility.\n(SCROLL DOWN FOR LIVE UPDATES)\nThree reactors have had at least partial meltdowns, but an even greater danger has emerged. Japanese and U.S. concerns were increasingly focusing on the pools used to store spent nuclear fuel: Some of the pools are dry or nearly empty and the rods could heat up and spew radiation.\nIt could take days and \"possibly weeks\" to get the complex under control, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jazcko said. He defended the U.S. decision to recommend a 50-mile evacuation zone for its citizens, a much stronger measure than Japan has taken.\nA senior official with the U.N.'s nuclear safety agency said there had been \"no significant worsening\" at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant but that the situation remained \"very serious.\" Graham Andrew told reporters in Vienna that nuclear fuel rods in two reactors were only about half covered with water, and in a third they were also not completely submerged.\nIf the fuel is not fully covered, rising temperatures and pressure will increase the chances of complete meltdowns that would release much larger amounts of radioactive material than the failing plant has emitted so far.\nLow levels of radiation have been detected well beyond Tokyo, which is 140 miles (220 kilometers) south of the plant, but hazardous levels have been limited to the plant itself. Still, the crisis triggered by last week's earthquake and tsunami has forced thousands to evacuate and drained Tokyo's normally vibrant streets of life, its residents either leaving town or holing up in their homes.\nPresident Barack Obama appeared on television to assure Americans that officials do not expect harmful amounts of radiation to reach the U.S. or its territories. He also said the U.S. was offering Japan any help it could provide, and said he was asking for a comprehensive review of U.S. nuclear plant safety.\nJapanese and American assessments of the crisis have differed, with the plant's owner denying Jazcko's report Wednesday that Unit 4's spent fuel pool was dry and that anyone who gets close to the plant could face potentially lethal doses of radiation. But a Tokyo Electric Power Co. executive moved closer to the U.S. position Thursday.\n\"Considering the amount of radiation released in the area, the fuel rods are more likely to be exposed than to be covered,\" Yuichi Sato said.\nWorkers have been dumping seawater when possible to control temperatures at the plant since the quake and tsunami knocked out power to its cooling systems, but they tried even more desperate measures on Unit 3's reactor and cooling pool.\nTwo Japanese military CH-47 Chinook helicopters began dumping seawater on Unit 3 on Thursday morning, defense ministry spokeswoman Kazumi Toyama said. The choppers doused the reactor with at least four loads of water in just the first 10 minutes, though television footage showed much of it appearing to disperse in the wind.\nChopper crews flew missions of about 40 minutes each to limit their radiation exposure, passing over the reactor with loads of about 2,000 gallons (7,500 liters) of water. Another 9,000 gallons (35,000 liters) of water were blasted from military trucks with high-pressure sprayers used to extinguish fires at plane crashes, though the vehicles had to stay safely back from areas deemed to have too much radiation.\nSpecial police units with water cannons were also tried, but they could not reach the targets from safe distances and had to pull back, said Yasuhiro Hashimoto, a spokesman for Japan's nuclear safety agency.\nUnit 3's reactor uses a fuel that combines plutonium, better known as an ingredient in nuclear weapons, and reprocessed uranium. The presence of this mixed oxide fuel, or MOX, means potentially that two very harmful radioactive products could be released into the environment.\nTokyo Electric Power said it believed workers were making headway in staving off a catastrophe both with the spraying and, especially, with efforts to complete an emergency power line to restart the plant's own electric cooling systems.\n\"This is a first step toward recovery,\" said Teruaki Kobayashi, a facilities management official at the power company. He said radiation levels \"have somewhat stabilized at their lows\" and that some of the spraying had reached its target, with one reactor emitting steam.\n\"We are doing all we can as we pray for the situation to improve,\" Kobayashi said. Authorities planned to spray again Friday, and Kobayashi said: \"Choices are limited. We just have to stick to what we can do most quickly and efficiently.\"\nWork on connecting the new power line to the plant was expected to begin Friday and take 10 to 15 hours, said Nuclear Safety Agency spokesman Minoru Ohgoda. But the utility is not sure the cooling systems will still function. If they don't, electricity won't help.\nFour of the plant's six reactors have seen fires, explosions, damage to the structures housing reactor cores, partial meltdowns or rising temperatures. Officials also recently said temperatures are rising even in the spent fuel pools of the other two reactors.\nThe troubles at the nuclear complex were set in motion by last Friday's 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami, which knocked out power and destroyed backup generators needed for the reactors' cooling systems. That added a nuclear crisis on top of twin natural disasters that likely killed well more than 10,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless.\nMario V. Bonaca, a physicist sits on an advisory committee to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said he believes the focus of the effort has shifted to the spent fuel pools. \"I understand that they've controlled the cooling of the cores,\" said Bonaca, who said he was basing his understanding on NRC and industry sources.\nThe storage pools need a constant source of cooling water. Even when removed from reactors, uranium rods are still extremely hot and must be cooled for months, possibly longer, to prevent them from heating up again and emitting radioactivity.\nWhile a core team of 180 emergency workers has been rotating in and out of the complex to avoid exposure, experts said that anyone working close to the reactors was almost certainly being exposed to radiation levels that could, at least, give them much higher cancer risks.\nExperts note, though, that radiation levels drop quickly with distance from the complex. While elevated radiation has been detected well outside the evacuation zone, experts say those levels are not dangerous.\nU.S. officials were taking no chances. In Washington, the State Department warned U.S. citizens to consider leaving the country and offered voluntary evacuation to family members and dependents of U.S. personnel in the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama and Nagoya.\nThe first flight left Thursday, with fewer than 100 people onboard, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy said. Plans also call for airlifting several thousand family members of U.S. armed forces personnel as well as nonessential staff stationed in Japan in the coming days.\nThe U.S. evacuation zone is far bigger than that established by Japan, which has called for a 12-mile zone and has told those within 20 miles to stay indoors. Daniel B. Poneman, U.S. deputy secretary of energy, said at the briefing that his agency agreed with the 50-mile zone - but said Japan's measures were also prudent.\nNearly a week after the earthquake and tsunami, police said more than 452,000 people were staying in schools and other shelters, as supplies of fuel, medicine and other necessities ran short. Both victims and aid workers appealed for more help, as the chances of finding more survivors dwindled.\nNoriko Sawaki lives in a battered neighborhood in Sendai that is still without running water and food or gasoline supplies and that, she said, makes life exhausting. \"It's frustrating, because we don't have a goal, something to strive for. This just keeps on going,\" said the 48-year-old.\nIn the town of Kesennuma, people lined up to get into a supermarket after a delivery of key supplies, such as instant rice packets and diapers.\nEach person was only allowed to buy 10 items, NHK television reported.\nWith diapers hard to find in many areas, an NHK program broadcast a how-to session on fashioning a diaper from a plastic shopping bag and a towel.

(Associated Press)\nFukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant is pictured before helicopters dump water on the stricken reactor to cool overheated fuel rods inside the core in Okumamachi, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, Thursday... (Associated Press)\nFour of the troubled Fukushima Dai-ichi plant's six reactor units have seen fires, explosions or partial meltdowns in the week since the tsunami. While the reactor cores where energy is generated are a concern, water in the pools used to store used nuclear fuel are also major worries. Water in at least one fuel pool _ in the complex's Unit 3 _ is believed to be dangerously low, exposing the stored fuel rods. Without enough water, the rods may heat further and spew out radiation.\n\"We see it as an extremely serious accident,\" Yukiya Amano, the head of the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters Friday just after arriving in Tokyo. \"This is not something that just Japan should deal with, and people of the entire world should cooperate with Japan and the people in the disaster areas.\"\nFrantic efforts were made Thursday to douse a number of units with water, and authorities were preparing to repeat many of those efforts.\nFriday's smoke came from the complex's Unit 2, and its cause was not known, the nuclear safety agency said. An explosion had hit the building on Tuesday, possibly damaging a crucial cooling chamber that sits below the reactor core.\nLast week's 9.0 quake and tsunami in Japan's northeast set off the nuclear problems by knocking out power to cooling systems at the reactors. The unfolding crises have led to power shortages in Japan, forced auto and other factories to close, sending shockwaves through global manufacturing and trade, and triggered a plunge in Japanese stock prices.\nLow levels of radiation have been detected well beyond Tokyo, which is 140 miles (220 kilometers) south of the plant, but hazardous levels have been limited to the plant itself. Still, the crisis has forced thousands to evacuate and drained Tokyo's normally vibrant streets of life, its residents either leaving town or holing up in their homes.\nThe Japanese government has been slow in releasing information on the crisis, even as the troubles have multiplied. In a country where the nuclear industry has a long history of hiding its safety problems, this has left many people _ in Japan and among governments overseas _ confused and anxious.\n\"I feel a sense of dread,\" said Yukiko Morioka, 63, who has seen business dry up at her lottery ticket booth in Tokyo. \"I'm not an expert, so it's difficult to understand what's going on. That makes it scarier.\"\nA senior official with the U.N. nuclear agency said Thursday there had been \"no significant worsening\" at the nuclear plant but that the situation remained \"very serious.\" Graham Andrew told reporters in Vienna that nuclear fuel rods in two reactors were only about half covered with water, and they were also not completely submerged in a third.\nEdano said Friday that Tokyo is asking the U.S. government for help and that the two are discussing the specifics.\n\"We are coordinating with the U.S. government as to what the U.S. can provide and what people really need,\" Edano said.\nAt times, the two close allies have offered starkly differing assessments over the dangers at Fukushima. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jazcko said Thursday that it could take days and \"possibly weeks\" to get the complex under control. He defended the U.S. decision to recommend a 50-mile (80-kilometer) evacuation zone for its citizens, wider than the 30-mile (50-kilometer) band Japan has ordered.\nCrucial to the effort to regain control over the Fukushima plant is laying a new power line to the plant, allowing operators to restore cooling systems. The operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., missed a deadline late Thursday but said Friday that workers hoped to complete the effort in 10 to 15 hours, said nuclear safety agency spokesman Minoru Ohgoda.\nBut the utility is not sure the cooling systems will still function. If they don't, electricity won't help.\nThe official death toll from the disasters stood at 6,405 as of Friday morning, with 10,259 missing, the national police agency said.\nPresident Barack Obama appeared on television to assure Americans that officials do not expect harmful amounts of radiation to reach the U.S. or its territories. He also said the U.S. was offering Japan any help it could provide.\nA utility official said Wednesday that the company has been unable to get information such as water levels and temperatures from any of the spent fuel pools in the four most troubled reactors.\nWorkers have been dumping seawater when possible to control temperatures at the plant since the quake and tsunami knocked out power to its cooling systems, but they tried even more desperate measures on Units 3 and 4.\nOn Thursday, military helicopters dumped thousands of gallons of water from huge buckets onto Unit 3, and also used military firefighting trucks normally used to extinguish fires at plane crashes.\nOfficials announced Friday they would not continue with the helicopter drops _ televised footage appeared to show much of that water blowing away _ but would continue spraying from the trucks.\nPolice said more than 452,000 people made homeless by the quake and tsunami were staying in schools and other shelters, as supplies of fuel, medicine and other necessities ran short. Both victims and aid workers appealed for more help, as the chances of finding more survivors dwindled.\nAt the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, a core team of 180 emergency workers has been rotating out of the complex to minimize radiation exposure.\nThe storage pools need a constant source of cooling water. Even when removed from reactors, uranium rods are still extremely hot and must be cooled for months, possibly longer, to prevent them from heating up again and emitting radioactivity.\nIn Washington, the State Department warned U.S. citizens to consider leaving the country and offered voluntary evacuation to family members and dependents of U.S. personnel in the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama and Nagoya.\n___\nYamaguchi reported from Tokyo. Associated Press writers George Jahn in Vienna, Elaine Kurtenbach, Shino Yuasa, Jeff Donn and Tim Sullivan in Tokyo contributed to this report. ", " While the findings were reassuring in the short term, the United States declined to back away from its warning to Americans there to stay at least 50 miles from the plant, setting up a far larger perimeter than the Japanese government had established. American officials did not release specific radiation readings.\nAmerican officials said their biggest worry was that a frenetic series of efforts by the Japanese military to get water into four of the plant's six reactors - including using water cannons and firefighting helicopters that dropped water but appeared to largely miss their targets - showed few signs of working.\n\"This is something that will likely take some time to work through, possibly weeks, as eventually you remove the majority of the heat from the reactors and then the spent fuel pool,\" said Gregory Jaczko, the chairman of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission , briefing reporters at the White House.\nThe effort by the Japanese to hook some electric power back up to the plant did not begin until Thursday and even if they succeed, it is unclear whether the cooling systems, in reactor buildings battered by a tsunami and then torn apart by hydrogen explosions, survived the crisis in good enough shape to be useful.\n\"What you are seeing are desperate efforts - just throwing everything at it in hopes something will work,\" said one American official with long nuclear experience who would not speak for attribution. \"Right now this is more prayer than plan.\"\nOn Thursday, President Obama said that the crisis had convinced him to order the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to do a comprehensive review of the safety of nuclear plants in the United States.\nAfter a day in which American and Japanese officials gave radically different assessments of the danger from the nuclear plant, the two governments tried on Thursday to join forces.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nExperts met in Tokyo to compare notes. The United States, with Japanese permission, began to put the intelligence-collection aircraft over the site, in hopes of gaining a view for Washington as well as its allies in Tokyo that did not rely on the announcements of officials from the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates Fukushima Daiichi.\nAmerican officials say they suspect that the company has consistently underestimated the risk and moved too slowly to contain the damage.\nAircraft normally used to monitor North Korea's nuclear weapons activities - a Global Hawk drone and U-2 spy planes - were flying missions over the reactor, trying to help the Japanese government map out its response to last week's 9.0-magnitude earthquake, the tsunami that followed and now the nuclear disaster.\nPresident Obama made an unscheduled stop at the Japanese Embassy to sign a condolence book, writing, \"My heart goes out to the people of Japan during this enormous tragedy.\" He added, \"Because of the strength and wisdom of its people, we know that Japan will recover, and indeed will emerge stronger than ever.\"\nLater, he appeared in the Rose Garden at the White House to offer continued American support for the earthquake and tsunami victims, and technical help at the nuclear site.\nVideo\nBut before the recovery can begin, the nuclear plant must be brought under control. On Friday, steam that was likely laced with radioactive particles was again rising over the plant, this time billowing from reactor No. 2, which suffered an explosion Tuesday. But Japanese authorities said they did not yet know the cause of the latest release.\nAmerican officials, meanwhile, remained fixated on the temperature readings inside that reactor and two others that had been operating until the earthquake shut them down, as well as at the plant's spent fuel pools, looking for any signs that their high levels of heat were going down. If the fuel rods are uncovered and exposed to air, they heat up and can burst into flames, spewing radioactive elements.\nSo far the officials saw no signs of dropping temperatures. And the Web site of the International Atomic Energy Agency , the United Nations nuclear watchdog, made it clear that there were no readings at all from some critical areas. Part of the American effort, by satellites and aircraft, is to identify the hot spots, something the Japanese have not been able to do in some cases.\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Made for quick assessments of radiation emergencies, the Aerial Measuring System is an instrument system that fits on a helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft to sample air and survey the land below.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nDaniel B. Poneman, the deputy secretary of energy, said at a White House briefing on Thursday that preliminary results of the initial flights \"are consistent with the recommendations that came down from the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,\" which led to the 50-mile evacuation guideline given to American expatriates. Although the worst contamination is closer to the plant, the recommendation takes into account the possibility of shifting winds or greater emissions.\nThe State Department has also said it would fly out of the country any dependents of American diplomats or military personnel within the region of the plant and as far south as Tokyo. Space will be made for other Americans who cannot get a flight, it said.\nGetting the Japanese to accept the American detection equipment was a delicate diplomatic maneuver, which some Japanese officials originally resisted. But as it became clear that conditions at the plant were spinning out of control, and with Japanese officials admitting they had little hard evidence about whether there was water in the cooling pools or breaches in the reactor containment structures, they began to accept more help.\nThe sensors on the instrument pod are good at mapping radioactive isotopes, like cesium 137, which has been detected around the nuclear plant and has a half-life of 30 years. In high doses, it can cause acute radiation sickness . Lower doses can alter cellular function, leading to an increased risk of cancer .\nCesium 137 can enter the body through many foods, including milk.\nOn Wednesday, when the American Embassy in Tokyo, on advice from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, told Americans to evacuate a radius of \"approximately 50 miles\" around the Fukushima plant, the recommendation was based on a specific calculation of risk of radioactive fallout in the affected area.\nIn a statement, the commission said the advice grew out of its assessment that projected radiation doses within the evacuation zone might exceed one rem to the body or five rems to the thyroid gland. That organ is extremely sensitive to iodine 131 - another of the deadly byproducts of nuclear fuel, this one causing thyroid cancer .\nThe commission says that the average American is exposed to about 0.62 rem of radiation each year from natural and manmade sources.\nThe American-provided instruments in Japan measure real levels of radiation on the ground. In contrast, scientists around the world have also begun to draw up forecasts of how the prevailing winds pick up the Japanese radioactive material and carry it over the Pacific in invisible plumes.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nPrivate analysts said the United States was also probably monitoring the reactor crisis with spy satellites that can spot the heat from fires - helping it independently assess the state of the reactor complex from a distance.\nJeffrey G. Lewis, an intelligence specialist at the Monterey Institute, a research center, noted that the Japanese assessment of Reactor No. 4 at the Daiichi complex seemed to depend in part on visual surveillance by helicopter pilots.\n\"I've got to think that, if we put our best assets into answering that question, we can do better,\" he said in an interview.\nOne main concern at No. 4 has been a fire that was burning there earlier in the week; American officials are not convinced that the fire has gone out.\nAmerican officials have also worried that the spent-fuel pool at that reactor has run dry, exposing the rods. Japanese officials, however, have concentrated much of their recent efforts on Reactor No. 3, which has been intermittently releasing radiation from what the authorities believe may be a ruptured containment vessel around the reactor. Temperatures at that reactor's spent fuel pool are also high.\nPerhaps because of the difficulties experienced Thursday trying to accurately drop water from helicopters, the Japanese military announced Friday that it was halting those efforts for at least a day."], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "3.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "938, 1067;1069, 1110;1199, 1252", "docSpanText": "The effort by the Japanese to hook some electric power back up to the plant did not begin until Thursday and even if they succeed<SPAN_SEP>it is unclear whether the cooling systems<SPAN_SEP>survived the crisis in good enough shape to be useful"}, {"documentFile": "3.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "3304, 3467", "docSpanText": "steam that was likely laced with radioactive particles was again rising over the plant, this time billowing from reactor No. 2, which suffered an explosion Tuesday"}, {"documentFile": "3.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "630, 711;812, 896", "docSpanText": "This is something that will likely take some time to work through, possibly weeks<SPAN_SEP>said Gregory Jaczko, the chairman of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission"}, {"documentFile": "3.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "317, 597", "docSpanText": "American officials said their biggest worry was that a frenetic series of efforts by the Japanese military to get water into four of the plant's six reactors - including using water cannons and firefighting helicopters that dropped water but appeared to largely miss their targets"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1, 197", "docSpanText": "Smoke billowed from a building at Japan's crippled nuclear power plant Friday as emergency crews worked to reconnect electricity to cooling systems and spray more water on overheating nuclear fuel"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "4507, 4659", "docSpanText": "Friday's smoke came from the complex's Unit 2, and its cause was not known, the nuclear safety agency said.

Scientists have finally recovered stem cells from... (Associated Press)\nScientists have finally recovered stem cells from cloned human embryos, a longstanding goal that could lead to new treatments for such illnesses as Parkinson's disease and diabetes.\nA prominent expert called the work a landmark, but noted that a different, simpler technique now under development may prove more useful.\nStem cells can turn into any cell of the body, so scientists are interested in using them to create tissue for treating disease. Transplanting brain tissue might treat Parkinson's disorder, for example, and pancreatic tissue might be used for diabetes.\nBut transplants run the risk of rejection, so more than a decade ago, researchers proposed a way around that: Create tissue from stem cells that bear the patient's own DNA, obtained with a process called therapeutic cloning.\nIf DNA from a patient is put into a human egg, which is then grown into an early embryo, the stem cells from that embryo would provide a virtual genetic match. So in theory, tissues created from them would not be rejected by the patient.\nThat idea was met with some ethical objections because harvesting the stem cells involved destroying human embryos.\nScientists have tried to get stem cells from cloned human embryos for about a decade, but they've failed. Generally, that's because the embryos stopped developing before producing the cells. In 2004, a South Korean scientist claimed to have gotten stem cells from cloned human embryos, but that turned out to be a fraud.\nIn Wednesday's edition of the journal Cell, however, scientists in Oregon report harvesting stem cells from six embryos created from donated eggs. Two embryos had been given DNA from skin cells of a child with a genetic disorder, and the others had DNA from fetal skin cells.\nShoukhrat Mitalipov of the Oregon Health & Science University, who led the research, said the success came not from a single technical innovation, but from revising a series of steps in the process. He noted it had taken six years to reach the goal after doing it with monkey embryos.\nMitalipov also said that based on monkey work, he believes human embryos made with the technique could not develop into cloned babies, and he has no interest in trying to do that. Scientists have cloned more than a dozen kinds of mammals, starting with Dolly the sheep.\nThe new work was financed by the university and the Leducq Foundation in Paris.\nDr. George Daley, a stem cell expert at Children's Hospital Boston who didn't participate in the work, called the new results \"one landmark step in a very long journey\" toward creating DNA-matched transplant tissue.\nNow, Daley said, scientists must compare the embryo-cloning approach with another technology that reprograms blood or skin cells directly into substitutes for embryonic stem cells. This reprogramming approach is technically simpler and doesn't involve embryos or require the donation of human eggs, and it was widely acclaimed when it was reported in 2007. Its Japanese developer shared a Nobel Prize last year.\nBut these substitute cells show some molecular differences compared to embryonic ones, which has led to questions about whether they can safely be used for treating patients. So it's essential to compare the cells from the two methods, Daley said.\nThe new results mean \"we have another tool,\" he said. \"We have to learn more about this tool.\"\nDaley said he believed scientists will prefer using the reprogramming approach unless it can be proven \"beyond a shadow of a doubt\" that embryo cloning produces better cells for treating patients.\nMitalipov said he believed his technique would present a particular advantage for treating patients with a certain type of rare diseases. These are caused by mutations in genes of the mitochondria, the power plants of cells. He noted his technique, unlike the cell-reprogramming approach, would supply tissue with new mitochondrial genes that could replace defective ones. Those new genes would come from the egg.\nThe Rev. Tad Pacholczyk, director of education for National Catholic Bioethics Center, an independent think tank in Philadelphia, reiterated his opposition to embryo cloning, calling the approach unethical.\n\"It involves the decision to utilize early human beings as repositories for obtaining desired cells,\" he said. \"You're creating them only to destroy them.\"\nMarcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society in Berkeley, California, said she was glad that Mitalipov doubted the embryos could be used to clone babies. She said the report still provides a good opportunity for the federal government to ban the use of cloning for reproduction. ", " OHSU Photos\nIt was hailed some 15 years ago as the great hope for a biomedical revolution: the use of cloning techniques to create perfectly matched tissues that would someday cure ailments ranging from diabetes to Parkinson's disease. Since then, the approach has been enveloped in ethical debate, tainted by fraud and, in recent years, overshadowed by a competing technology. Most groups gave up long ago on the finicky core method - production of patient-specific embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from cloning. A quieter debate followed: do we still need 'therapeutic' cloning?\nA paper published this week1 by Shoukhrat Mitalipov, a reproductive biology specialist at the Oregon Health and Science University in Beaverton, and his colleagues is sure to rekindle that debate. Mitalipov and his team have finally created patient-specific ESCs through cloning, and they are keen to prove that the technology is worth pursuing.\nTherapeutic cloning, or somatic-cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), begins with the same process used to create Dolly, the famous cloned sheep, in 1996. A donor cell from a body tissue such as skin is fused with an unfertilized egg from which the nucleus has been removed. The egg 'reprograms' the DNA in the donor cell to an embryonic state and divides until it has reached the early, blastocyst stage. The cells are then harvested and cultured to create a stable cell line that is genetically matched to the donor and that can become almost any cell type in the human body.\nMany scientists have tried to create human SCNT cell lines; none had succeeded until now. Most infamously, Woo Suk Hwang of Seoul National University in South Korea used hundreds of human eggs to report two successes, in 2004 and 2005. Both turned out to be fabricated. Other researchers made some headway. Mitalipov created SCNT lines in monkeys2 in 2007. And Dieter Egli, a regenerative medicine specialist at the New York Stem Cell Foundation, successfully produced human SCNT lines3, but only when the egg's nucleus was left in the cell. As a result, the cells had abnormal numbers of chromosomes, limiting their use.\nMonkeying around\nMitalipov and his group began work on their new study last September, using eggs from young donors recruited through a university advertising campaign. In December, after some false starts, cells from four cloned embryos that Mitalipov had engineered began to grow. \"It looks like colonies, it looks like colonies,\" he kept thinking. Masahito Tachibana, a fertility specialist from Sendai, Japan, who is finishing a 5-year stint in Mitalipov's laboratory, nervously sectioned the 1-millimetre-wide clumps of cells and transferred them to new culture plates, where they continued to grow - evidence of success. Mitalipov cancelled his holiday plans. \"I was happy to spend Christmas culturing cells,\" he says. \"My family understood.\"\nThe success came through minor technical tweaks. The researchers used inactivated Sendai virus (known to induce fusion of cells) to unite the egg and body cells, and an electric jolt to activate embryo development. When their first attempts produced six blastocysts but no stable cell lines, they added caffeine, which protects the egg from premature activation.\nNone of these techniques is new, but the researchers tested them in various combinations in more than 1,000 monkey eggs before moving on to human cells. \"They made the right improvements to the protocol,\" says Egli. \"It's big news. It's convincing. I believe it.\"\nThe experiments took only a few months, Mitalipov says. \"People say, you did it in monkeys in 2007. Why did it take six years in humans?\" Most of the time, he says, was spent navigating US regulations on embryo research.\nThe researchers carried out a battery of tests to prove that their SCNT cells could form various cell types, including heart cells that are able to contract spontaneously.\nTheir first cell lines were created using fetal skin cells; others were derived using donor cells from an 8-month-old patient with a rare metabolic disorder called Leigh syndrome, to prove that ESCs could be made from more mature donor cells. The technique does not require prohibitive numbers of eggs: it took 15 from one donor to produce one cell line and 5 from a different donor to make another. \"The efficiency was the most impressive thing,\" says George Daley, a stem-cell expert at Children's Hospital Boston in Massachusetts.\nSuch improvements might be necessary to convince people that SCNT research is still worthwhile. Egg donors for the experiment received US$3,000-7,000 in compensation. This is expensive and, according to some bioethicists, risks creating an organ trade that preys on the poor. Because the technique requires the destruction of embryos, funds from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) cannot be used to make or study SCNT-derived cell lines, hampering further clinical research. (Mitalipov maintains a separate laboratory for NIH-funded research.)\nPublic fears that the technology might be used to create human clones are another sticking point. The research might spark \"cloning hysteria\" that opponents of stem-cell research could capitalize on, says Bernard Siegel, executive director of the Genetics Policy Institute in Palm Beach, Florida. But Mitalipov has tried without success for more than a decade to produce a monkey by cloning. Tachibana says that an upcoming publication will explain why reproductive cloning of humans is not possible using their SCNT technique.\nStill, Daley and most other stem-cell researchers have shifted to another method for creating genetically matched, patient-specific cell lines: reprogramming adult cells to an embryonic state to produce induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. First reported in 2006, the technique does not involve eggs, cloning or destruction of embryos4. \"Honestly, the most surprising thing [about this paper] is that somebody is still doing human [SCNT] in the era of iPS cells,\" says Miodrag Stojkovic, who studies iPS cells for regenerative medicine and runs a fertility clinic in Leskovac, Serbia.\nBut Stojkovic, like others, awaits the results of head-to-head comparisons between iPS and SCNT cells. Some research has shown that iPS cells are not completely reprogrammed and that stem cells derived from SCNT are more like embryonic stem cells derived from in vitro fertilization. Mitalipov and Tachibana are now conducting a study to compare iPS cells and SCNT cells derived from the same donor cell. \"These results,\" says Daley, \"will be fascinating.\""], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "577, 594;606, 608;630, 720;1070, 1491", "docSpanText": "A paper published<SPAN_SEP>by<SPAN_SEP>a reproductive biology specialist at the Oregon Health and Science University in Beaverton<SPAN_SEP>A donor cell from a body tissue such as skin is fused with an unfertilized egg from which the nucleus has been removed.

Four years later, Rosita Garnier, 38, was jailed by a court in Blois for murdering three newborns.\nSylvie Coulon, 27, from Limoges, was jailed in 1990 for killing four infants and putting their bodies out with the rubbish. And Ci? 1/2 line Lesage, 34, admitted the murder of seven babies found in a cellar in Normandy in 2007.\n\"It's easy to come up with a narrative to explain why it happens in contemporary India or 17th-century Europe, for example, but why is it happening in 21st-century France?\" asks Michelle Oberman, author of When Mothers Kill.\nThe recent French cases also deviate sharply from the pattern in the US, she said, where the mother is usually very young, not in a relationship and who conceals the pregnancy from her parents, and then kills the child as soon as it is born.\nOne of the conditions often offered up to explain infanticide is \"pregnancy denial\", a psychiatric condition where a woman either doesn't realise or cannot accept she's having a baby, not even enough to consider an abortion.\n\"Women can carry on menstruating, they don't put on weight and their breasts don't get bigger because the denial is so strong it overcomes the physical manifestations of pregnancy,\" explained Anne Carpenter, a consultant forensic clinical psychologist in Glasgow. When the baby arrives, she is forced to confront that reality, and sometimes with catastrophic results.\n\"With no sense of the child as an individual being, it is viewed more as an inconvenience, and something to be got rid of in the same way as you get rid of the trash,\" she added.\nBut denial is not the only explanation. Pierre Lamothe, a French psychiatrist, said in many cases he had studied, the women wanted to be pregnant because it made them feel fully feminine, but they did not want children. \"When the child appears, it has no real existence,\" he said. \"Mentally, the woman does not accept that it is a living person.\" ", " Pascal Rossignol / Reuters Candles are displayed in front of the house where the bodies of newborn babies were found in Villers-au-Tertre, France, on July 29, 2010\nThe question is as horrifying as it is important to ask: Why are a rising number of French women killing their newborn babies? Finding the answer has become a matter of urgency following the discovery on Wednesday of eight infants allegedly smothered to death and buried by their mother in northern France. And with that case marking at least the fifth instance of multiple infanticide reported in France since 2003, it has become vital for the nation to confront the phenomenon that appears to be behind it all: a mental condition known as pregnancy denial.\nThis latest case of newborn murder in France was uncovered in the northern town of Villiers-au-Tertre, after eight tiny bodies were found buried in the gardens of two separate homes. Six of the cadavers were unearthed on July 29 by police at the house of Dominique Cottrez, 45, and her husband Pierre-Marie, 47. Investigators searched their home after the resident of a house previously owned by Dominique's parents turned up two tiny bodies on July 24 while digging a pool in the backyard. According to the French prosecutor leading the inquiry in the town, a short distance south of Lille, Dominique has admitted to hiding her pregnancies  and the killings of her babies  from her husband, whom police describe as being \"dumbstruck\" by the revelations. Dominique was charged for the murders; Pierre-Marie has been cleared of wrongdoing and released but could yet become a subject of investigation. (See the top 10 crime stories of 2009.)\nThe case in Villiers-au-Tertre is only the most recent example of a father of slain babies being apparently unaware of his wife's pregnancies. Four other such cases since 2003 include that of Veronique Courjault, 42, who was convicted in June 2009 of killing three of her newborns  two of whom she hid in a freezer and were later discovered by her husband. And this past March, Celine Lesage, 38, was found guilty of murdering six of her babies after she hid her pregnancies from the men who had fathered them. Both women were sentenced to prison  Courjault for eight years and Lesage for 15.\nExperts explained those cases as resulting from pregnancy denial, an often misunderstood and minimized condition. According to Michel Delcroix, a former gynecologist who served as a court expert in the Courjault trial and others involving pregnancy issues, pregnancy denial is a quasi-schizophrenic condition in which women either don't realize or cannot accept that they are with child  not even enough to have an abortion. Whether these women are afflicted with the condition before they deliver or as they're suddenly giving birth, Delcroix explains, the psychological denial is so strong that they refuse to believe they're pregnant even when the reality confronts them. (See more on pregnancy.)\n\"These women are so convinced pregnancy is impossible that once the child they never wanted arrives, they don't accept it as real and get rid of it to restore order to what they believe is nonpregnant reality,\" Delcroix says. \"However terrible its consequences, pregnancy denial acts in infanticide cases much as a psychotic state that drives someone to kill another person does. Yet we still try women for what they do during pregnancy denial when we don't try psychotic killers deemed not responsible for their actions.\" Delcroix and others who are fighting for pregnancy denial to be medically and legally recognized as an illness argue that improving ways to identify and treat these women makes more sense than simply punishing the crimes they commit as a result of it.\nWhat causes the condition? Several things, Delcroix says, including previous trauma such as beatings and rape. But other, nonphysical factors can also be involved, and denial can kick in even if a woman has already had and raised children without a problem  Lesage has a 14-year-old son; Dominique Cottrez has two grown daughters. And while pregnancy denial has been around for decades or longer, Delcroix says it's rising in frequency. The probable reason, he says, is changes in wider social factors that have downgraded the value of childhood, parenting and family.\nBut in some cases, it can also be a matter of women simply failing to see themselves as mothers. \"Some women never manage to update their self-identity during pregnancy, [while others] want to become pregnant without wanting to procreate,\" psychiatrist Pierre Lamothe told Le Parisien on Thursday. \"When the child arrives, it doesn't really exist for them. They don't give it life, in psychological terms. If they saw it as a [real] baby, they wouldn't kill it.\" (See the top 25 crimes of the past century.)\nOthers just never realize  or acknowledge  that they're with child. Experts on pregnancy denial say most sufferers are either sufficiently overweight or experience such little body change that they simply assume they've gained some weight. In France, 230 women a year discover their pregnancy only while giving birth. Though just a fraction resort to infanticide, Delcroix fears there are more of those cases that remain undiscovered than there are ones that come to light, as in Villiers-au-Tertre. And he poses a chilling question: Does anyone really believe that the spreading phenomenon of pregnancy denial  and the infanticide it can lead to  is purely a French problem?"], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "222, 229;249, 275;284, 290", "docSpanText": "Why are<SPAN_SEP>French women killing their<SPAN_SEP>babies"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "629, 722", "docSpanText": "the phenomenon that appears to be behind it all: a mental condition known as pregnancy denial"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2514, 2565", "docSpanText": "pregnancy denial is a quasi-schizophrenic condition"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2514, 2530;2566, 2643", "docSpanText": "pregnancy denial<SPAN_SEP>in which women either don't realize or cannot accept that they are with child"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2958, 3107;3168, 3181", "docSpanText": "These women are so convinced pregnancy is impossible that once the child they never wanted arrives, they don't accept it as real and get rid of it to<SPAN_SEP>Delcroix says"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1247, 1330", "docSpanText": "One of the conditions often offered up to explain infanticide is \"pregnancy denial\""}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "904, 951", "docSpanText": "but why is it happening in 21st-century France?"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1332, 1429", "docSpanText": "a psychiatric condition where a woman either doesn't realise or cannot accept she's having a baby"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1892, 2017", "docSpanText": "it is viewed more as an inconvenience, and something to be got rid of in the same way as you get rid of the trash,\" she added"}, {"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1473, 1652;1736, 1797;1841, 1961", "docSpanText": "Women can carry on menstruating, they don't put on weight and their breasts don't get bigger because the denial is so strong it overcomes the physical manifestations of pregnancy,<SPAN_SEP>When the baby arrives, she is forced to confront that reality<SPAN_SEP>With no sense of the child as an individual being, it is viewed more as an inconvenience, and something to be got rid of"}], "summary": "It's a good question.

A source told The Mail on Sunday that the gang of criminals checked the contents of the containers against a list, \"throwing the ones they didn't want away.\" The books were being stored in the warehouse temporarily as they made their way to the California Book Fair.\nThe gang then placed the rare books into holdalls and pulled them onto the roof of the building using ropes. The bags were then placed into a van and driven away.\nThe Mail on Sunday reports that the thieves likely stole the books to order, as it would be difficult to resell the titles. The newspaper says that scientific works, of the type stolen in the raid, \"are particularly in demand.\" It speculates that a wealthy collector known as \"the Astronomer\" may have ordered gangs to steal books for him.\nThe most valuable book stolen in the raid is a 1566 edition of \"De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium\" by Copernicus. The book, which can be translated as \"On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres,\" set out Copernicus' theory that the Sun is at the centre of the universe, not the Earth.\nThe owner of the rare Copernicus book stolen in the raid, identified only as a dealer from Padua in Italy, told The Mail on Sunday that \"It was clearly a robbery done to order.

The book was a landmark work covering physics and mathematics.\nA 1506 edition of Dante's \"Divine Comedy\" was also stolen in the raid.

Photograph: Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty Images\nIn a rare book heist described as \"extraordinary\" for its Mission: Impossible-style stealth, a gang of thieves has stolen more than f2m worth of antiquarian books from a London warehouse. The three tome-raiders evaded the security system by boring holes through reinforced glass skylights and abseiling 40ft on ropes into the repository. The haul of more than 160 books included a 1566 copy of De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium by Copernicus, worth an estimated f215,000, as well as works by Galileo, Isaac Newton, Leonardo da Vinci and a 1569 edition of Dante's Divine Comedy.\nThe question is, what happens to the books now? How might they be sold? And who would buy them? \"Criminals first try to cash out on these crimes,\" leading art lawyer Chris Marinello, CEO of London based Art Recovery International, tells me. \"They are looking for buyers and the more publicity the crime gets, they more difficult it becomes to sell these items. Placing them on international databases, such as ARTIVE.org, which records stolen objects so they can not be sold knowingly in the marketplace, means reputable dealers and collectors will not touch them.\"\nMarinello, who has been working to reduce the trade in illicit cultural heritage for three decades, explains that this, unfortunately, is when the \"second crime\" often takes places. \"The books might then be broken up,\" he says. \"Some of the illuminated manuscripts and engravings contained therein might be traded in the art market, where many buyers don't know they were cut out of rare books. It becomes a lot more difficult to trace.\"\nThe theft of rare books, manuscripts and maps from libraries and other repositories is thought to be on the rise. An alarmingly titled conference at the British Library in 2015, The Written Heritage of Mankind in Peril, was prompted by two major heists at European libraries, both of which turned out to be inside jobs. What continues to confound the international rare book market - estimated to be worth $500m (f380m) a year - is how easily stolen books are fenced and resold.\nSo what's the solution? \"It's urgent at this point that the victims come forward and record these losses,\" Marinello says. \"It's really important to make these books unsellable by disseminating that information. That's the key. In my experience the books will either turn up very shortly or when the criminals know they can't sell them they'll go underground and be traded or sold at 5%-10% of their true value. We might expect a ransom demand as well from someone looking to shake down an insurance company. The next few days and weeks are very important from an investigative point of view.\"\nDoes he believe, as some are saying, that the books might have been stolen to order by a specialist collector? \"I would strongly refute that,\" he replies. \"I think this was more likely similar to the Lufthansa heist in Goodfellas, where somebody had inside information that they were being kept in a warehouse and were particularly valuable.

It smacks of an inside job, an art attorney tells the Guardian, likening it to the Lufthansa heist in the movie Goodfellas. \"Somebody had inside information that they were being kept in a warehouse and were particularly valuable,\" he says. \"Then someone allowed that information to leak out, and criminals took advantage.\" (One book dealer was murdered for his copy of a children's classic.)"}, "test74": {"documents": ["Earlier this week, we introduced a set of updates to our privacy policy and terms of service to help our users better understand our service.

Thank you for your feedback, and I look forward to all that Instagram has to bring in the New Year.\nThank you,\nKevin Systrom co-founder, Instagram ", " Eric Piermont/Agence France-Presse - Getty Images\n\nSAN FRANCISCO - In the aftermath of the uproar over changes to Instagram's privacy policy and terms of service earlier this week, the company did an about-face late Thursday.\nIn a blog post on the company's site, Kevin Systrom, Instagram's co-founder, said that where advertising was concerned, the company would revert to its previous terms of service, which have been in effect since October 2010.\n\"Rather than obtain permission from you to introduce possible advertising products we have not yet developed,\" he wrote, \"we are going to take the time to complete our plans, and then come back to our users and explain how we would like for our advertising business to work.\" Users had been particularly concerned by a clause in Instagram's policy introduced on Monday that suggested Instagram would share users' data - like their favorite places, bands, restaurants and hobbies - with Facebook and its advertisers to better target ads.\nThey also took issue with an update to the company's terms of service that suggested users' photos could be used in advertisements, without compensation and even without their knowledge.\nThe terms of that user agreement said, \"You agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your user name, likeness, photos (along with any associated metadata) and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you.\"\nFollowing a reaction that included customers defecting to other services, Mr. Systrom told Instagram users on Tuesday that the new policy had been misinterpreted. \"It is our mistake that this language is confusing,\" he wrote, and he promised an updated agreement.\nThat statement apparently was not enough. With more people leaving the service, the company, which Facebook bought for $735 million this year, reacted again by returning to the old rules.\nAcknowledging those concerns late Thursday, Mr. Systrom wrote: \"I want to be really clear: Instagram has no intention of selling your photos, and we never did. We don't own your photos - you do.\"\nMr. Systrom said the company would still be tweaking its privacy policy to quell users' fears that their photos might pop-up on third-party sites without their consent.\nBut Mr. Systrom did not clarify how Instagram planned to monetize its service in the future. Facebook is under pressure to make Instagram earn income.\n\"It's a free service - they have to monetize somewhere,\" said John Casasanta, a principal at Tap Tap Tap, the maker of Camera+, a photo-filter app that has shunned advertising and instead charges users for premium features. \"The days of the simple banner ads are gone. Their user data is too valuable.\"\nIt was unclear whether reverting its terms of service would be enough to satisfy high-profile users like National Geographic, which stopped using its Instagram account in light of the moves, or other users who have aired their grievances on Twitter and Facebook.\nThe controversy has driven traffic and new users to several other photo-sharing applications.\nPheed, an Instagram-like app that gives users the option to monetize their own content by charging followers to see their posts, gained more users than any other app in the United States on Thursday. By Thursday morning, Pheed had jumped to the ninth most downloaded social-networking app in Apple's iTunes store, just ahead of LinkedIn.\nO. D. Kobo, Pheed's chief executive, said Thursday morning that subscriptions to the service had quadrupled this week and that in the last 24 hours users had uploaded 300,000 new files to the service - more uploads than any other 24-hour-period since Pheed made its debut six weeks ago.\nAnother runaway success was Flickr, Yahoo's photo-sharing service, which redesigned its app last week to make it easier to share photos on Twitter. In a stroke of good fortune, it released the app to positive reviews just as Instagram announced it would no longer sync with Twitter, a Facebook rival.\nThe day before Instagram announced changes to its terms of service, Flickr's mobile app was ranked at around 175 in Apple's overall iTunes app charts. Since that day, the application skyrocketed to the high 20s.\nOf course, most of these services are still tiny compared to Instagram, which claims to have more than 100 million members who have uploaded upward of 5 billion photos using its service. And it was unclear if the services' newfound members had also deleted their Instagram accounts or were merely dabbling in other offerings. But the migration, whether temporary or permanent, was a reminder of the volatility of success and that the fall to bottom can sometimes be as swift as the rise to the top.\nFacebook and Instagram declined to say whether they had seen any significant number of account deletions or if they were concerned about losing ground in the photo-sharing market to rivals. Some photo apps took direct aim at Instagram. Camera+ even went so far as to include a snide, holiday-themed reference to Instagram's stumbles in an app update on Wednesday.\n\"We'll never do shady things with your shared pics, because it just isn't right,\" the update noted. \"On that note, happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!\""], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "92, 180", "docSpanText": "uproar over changes to Instagram's privacy policy and terms of service earlier this week"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "280, 289;304, 404", "docSpanText": "Instagram<SPAN_SEP>said that where advertising was concerned, the company would revert to its previous terms of service"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "227, 450", "docSpanText": "In a blog post on the company's site, Kevin Systrom, Instagram's co-founder, said that where advertising was concerned, the company would revert to its previous terms of service, which have been in effect since October 2010"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "265, 308;453, 725", "docSpanText": "Kevin Systrom, Instagram's co-founder, said<SPAN_SEP>Rather than obtain permission from you to introduce possible advertising products we have not yet developed,\" he wrote, \"we are going to take the time to complete our plans, and then come back to our users and explain how we would like for our advertising business to work"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1965, 2010", "docSpanText": "Mr. Systrom wrote: \"I want to be really clear"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1965, 1983;2012, 2079", "docSpanText": "Mr. Systrom wrote:<SPAN_SEP>Instagram has no intention of selling your photos, and we never did"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1965, 1982;2081, 2114", "docSpanText": "Mr. Systrom wrote<SPAN_SEP>We don't own your photos - you do"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1965, 2116", "docSpanText": "Mr. Systrom wrote: \"I want to be really clear: Instagram has no intention of selling your photos, and we never did.

", " Researchers: Elephants can tell the difference between human languages\nBy Agence France-Presse\nMonday, March 10, 2014 16:25 EDT\nAfrican elephants can differentiate between human languages and move away from those considered a threat, a skill they have honed to survive in the wild, researchers said Monday.\nThe study suggests elephants, already known to be intelligent creatures, are even more sophisticated than previously believed when it comes to understanding human dangers.\nAfrican elephants (Loxodonta africana) are the largest land animals on Earth and are considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and illegal hunting for their ivory tusks.\nResearchers played recordings of human voices for elephants at Amboseli National Park in Kenya to see how they would respond, according to a report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nSome of the voices were from local Maasai men, a group that herds cattle and sometimes comes into conflict with elephants over access to water and grazing space. Occasionally, elephants are killed in clashes with Maasai men, and vice-versa.\nOther recorded voices were from Kamba men, who tend to be farmers or employees of the national park, and who rarely represent a danger to elephants.\nStill other voices tested on the elephants included female Maasai speakers and young boys.\nAll were saying the same phrase: \"Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming.\"\nThe recorded voices were played for hundreds of elephants across 47 family groups during daylight hours.\nWhen elephants heard the adult male Maasai voices, they tended to gather together, start investigative smelling with their trunks, and move cautiously away.\nBut when elephants heard females, boys, or adult male Kamba speakers, they did not show concern.\n- Discriminating between languages -\n\"The ability to distinguish between Maasai and Kamba men delivering the same phrase in their own language suggests that elephants can discriminate between different languages,\" said co-author Graeme Shannon, a visiting fellow in psychology at the University of Sussex.\nThat is not the same as understanding what the words mean, but still shows that elephants can decipher the more sing-songy Maasai language from the Kamba tongue, perhaps based on inflections, use of vowels, and other cues.\n\"It is very sophisticated what the elephants are doing,\" said Keith Lindsay, a conservation biologist and member of the scientific advisory committee of the Amboseli Elephant Research Project.\n\"A lot of animals will take flight at just the general threat posed by people, but a smart animal doesn't do that,\" he told AFP.\n\"Their response to hearing Maasai men talking was to be alert, to move away, but not to run away in total fear,\" added Lindsay, who was not involved in the study.\n\"It is suggesting that elephants are capable of thinking, (of) recognizing that if Maasai men are talking, they are not likely to be hunting because if they were hunting, they would be quiet.\"\n- Wiser with age -\nElephant groups with older matriarchs in their midst did best at assessing the threat from different speakers, further bolstering the presumed role of learning in the animals' behavior.\nThe elephants also did not act the same way as they did when recordings of lions were played, as was shown in a previous study.\nIn those scenarios, they bunched together so that juveniles - those most at risk from a lion attack - were in the center, and moved toward the sounds as if to scare the lion away.\nWhen it comes to recognizing people, elephants may not be alone in this ability. Other research has suggested that wild bottlenose dolphins in Brazil have become so familiar with humans that they engage in cooperative hunting with artisanal fisherman.\nGreat apes, crows and even prairie dogs have also been shown to differentiate between humans on some level.\nA separate study published last month in the journal PLoS ONE showed elephants even have specific alarm calls for when humans are near, suggesting the relationship between people and elephants has reached a troubling point and that conservation efforts are more important than ever.\n\"We have become a formal enemy of the elephants,\" said Lori Marino, an expert on animal intelligence at Emory University.\n\"They can not only make some distinctions between us, but we are now on their list of species to watch out for.\"\n[Image via Agence France-Presse] ", " WASHINGTON (AP) - Dr. Seuss had it right: Horton really does hear a Who. Wild elephants can distinguish between human languages, and they can tell whether a voice comes from a man, woman or boy, a new study says.\nThis handout photo provided by the University of Sussex, taken in April 2011, shows a wild elephant in Amboseli National Park in Kenya reacting to sound played by scientists in experiments that show they... (Associated Press)\nThat's what researchers found when they played recordings of people for elephants in Kenya. Scientists say this is an advanced thinking skill that other animals haven't shown. It lets elephants figure out who is a threat and who isn't.\nThe result shows that while humans are studying elephants, the clever animals are also studying people and drawing on their famed powers of memory, said study author Karen McComb.\n\"Basically they have developed this very rich knowledge of the humans that they share their habitat with,\" said McComb , a professor of animal behavior and cognition at the University of Sussex in England.\n\"Memory is key. They must build up that knowledge somehow.\"\nThe study was released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nIt's close but not quite like the Dr. Seuss book, where the empathetic elephant Horton hears something that others can't hear.\nMcComb and colleagues went to Amboseli National Park in Kenya, where hundreds of wild elephants live among humans, sometimes coming in conflict over scarce water. The scientists used voice recordings of Maasai men, who on occasion kill elephants in confrontations over grazing for cattle, and Kamba men, who are less of a threat to the elephants. The recordings contained the same phrase in two different languages: \"Look over there. A group of elephants is coming.\"\nBy about a two-to-one margin, the elephants reacted defensively - retreating and gathering in a bunch - more to the Maasai language recording because it was associated with the more threatening human tribe, said study co-author Graeme Shannon of Colorado State University.\n\"They are making such a fine-level discrimination using human language skills,\" Shannon said. \"They're able to acquire quite detailed knowledge. The only way of doing this is with an exceptionally large brain.\"\nThey repeated the experiment with recordings of Maasai men and women. Since women almost never spear elephants, the animals reacted less to the women's voices. The same thing happened when they substituted young boys' voices.\n\"Making this kind of fine distinctions in human voice patterns is quite remarkable,\" said Emory University animal cognition expert Frans de Waal, who was not part of the study.\nWhile it shows quite a bit about elephant intelligence and adaptability, it also indicates a problem, said biologist Josh Plotnik, founder of Think Elephants International, a research and advocacy group.\n\"This is both fascinating in that it supports evidence we already have that these animals are behaviorally quite flexible, but also sad because it suggests that the conflict between humans and elephants is growing,\" Plotnik, who was not part of the study, wrote in an email.\nIn yet another experiment McComb and Shannon altered female and male voices, making female voices sound male by lowering their tone and resonance, and males sound female by raising their pitches.

"summary": "Speak the wrong language in front of an African elephant, and she may not like you much. In a study at a Kenyan national park, researchers played recordings of different languages and voices for 47 elephant family groups, comprising hundreds of animals. The recordings included the voices of Maasai men, whose cattle-herding can cause run-ins with elephants. Kamba men, on the other hand, are often farmers or national park workers and present little danger to elephants, AFP reports via Raw Story. While the languages recorded were different, the spoken phrase was the same: \"Look, look over there-a group of elephants is coming.\" When the elephants heard Maasai men, they prepared to protect themselves, sniffing around and moving together. But the voices of Kamba men didn't prompt much worry. \"They are making such a fine-level discrimination using human language skills,\" a study author tells the AP. \"They're able to acquire quite detailed knowledge.\" The elephants also appeared to be able to distinguish between men and women: Maasai women's voices didn't set off major alarm bells, nor did Maasai boys'. The findings come as humans and elephants overlap more often in the park, leading to occasional clashes, Discover notes. Indeed, the study is \"sad because it suggests that the conflict between humans and elephants is growing,\" says an expert."}, "test71": {"documents": ["DULUTH, Minn. - Authorities are releasing more information about the elderly Duluth couple found dead on Saturday.\nDuluth police say Ron Tarnowski, 82, and Mary Tarnowski, 78, were found on Saturday shortly before 4 p.m., after they were missing for eight days.\nA U.S. Border Patrol Helicopter found their vehicle in a rural area about 150 yards off of Highway 2 in the Brookston, Minnesota area. St. Louis County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Wade Rasch says it appears the couple drove off the road onto a swampy trail that was likely only used as a snowmobile trail during the winter.\nRasch said Mary Tarnowski was found in the car, which was stuck on the trail, and Ron Tarnowski was found closer to the highway. Rasch said it appears Ron went to get help after the car became stuck.\nRELATED: Police seek help finding missing Duluth couple\nThe autopsy results are pending, but Rasch said it's likely the couple died of exposure.\nA post on the Find Ron and Mary Tarnowski Facebook page stated, \"It is with great sadness that we must report that Ron and Mary Tarnowski have been found deceased in a remote area about a mile from their hunting camp.\"\nThe couple had been last seen on surveillance video at a Country Corner store near Brookston, Minnesota, around 1 p.m. on Saturday, July 29.\nRon had early-stage dementia, and Mary had right-sided paralysis, making it difficult to speak. ", " After a week-long search, Ron and Mary Tarnowski were discovered dead in swampy area in Duluth on Aug. 5. The couple was married for 59 years. (Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post)\nRon and Mary Tarnowski spent their days confined almost entirely to their home in Duluth, Minn.\nDecades ago, at age 42, Mary Tarnowski suffered from a stroke that left her paralyzed on the right side of her body, making it difficult for her to move or speak. Her husband, Ron, served as her caretaker for more than 35 years, assisting her with daily tasks and rarely leaving her side.\nBut in recent years, Ron Tarnowski, an Air Force veteran and retired captain for the local fire department, began showing signs of early-stage dementia, his son and police told The Washington Post. Suddenly, the tough man with a \"commanding presence,\" adventurous spirit and the build of a former football player needed to be taken care of, too.\nGetting around became even more difficult for the Tarnowskis - Mary, 78, and Ron, 81. The couple hardly ever left the home, which their son, Karl Tarnowski, built adjacent to his own so he could keep an eye on them.\nOccasionally, Mary Tarnowski would ask her husband to go for a drive, perhaps to nearby restaurants. But they never stayed away for very long and would always be back well before nightfall.\n\"When the sun sets they've always been home,\" Karl Tarnowski, the younger of the couple's two sons, said in an interview with The Washington Post.\nSo it was troubling when, on the evening of July 29, Karl Tarnowski and his wife found the elderly couple's home empty and their Chevy Tahoe gone.\nMary and Ron Tarnowski had driven away that day without telling anyone. They left behind a cellphone, Mary's wheelchair and purse, and their medications. At 10 p.m., their worried children called the police to report them missing.\nFor the next seven days, the family, law enforcement and hundreds of community members in Duluth launched an extensive search effort that covered thousands of miles.\nRelatives and local authorities posted fliers all over the surrounding area and posted updates on a Facebook group called \"Find Ron and Mary Tarnowski,\" which was followed by more than 7,000 people across Minnesota and the United States. Retired Duluth firefighters joined the search for one of their own.\nDuluth residents tied purple ribbons around trees and on businesses, in honor of the Alzheimer's Association. They held news conferences outside the Tarnowskis' home attended by the Duluth police chief and about 100 community members.\nRelatives and police officials weighed several possible theories of where the couple could have gone. Perhaps they had headed northwest to Grand Rapids, Minn., where their sons had been spending the day. Maybe they were stopping by their family's hunting shack, about 30 miles away from their Duluth home.\nOn Saturday afternoon, eight days after the couple went missing, the family received their answer, and a tragic end to their strenuous search. A U.S. Border Patrol helicopter found the couple's Chevy Tahoe on an overgrown, abandoned driveway in a swampy area off the road just two miles away from the family's hunting property. They were near Brookston, a town about 30 miles from their Duluth home.\nMary's Tarnowski's body was discovered inside the Tahoe, and her husband's body was found outside the vehicle, about 50 feet from the road.\nAuthorities suspect Ron Tarnowski may have driven onto the trail accidentally before getting his car stuck in the mud, said Lt. Mike Ceynowa, public information officer for the Duluth Police Department. He said police think Tarnowski left the vehicle to seek help.\nAutopsy results are pending, but Karl Tarnowski said there are signs that his mother died of a combination of dehydration and heat while sitting in the car on a day with temperatures in the upper 80s. There is also evidence that Ron Tarnowski had fallen down while trudging through the mud, his son said.\nBoth are believed to have died July 29, the day they went missing, the son said. No foul play is suspected, according to authorities.\n\"It's a horrific case,\" Ceynowa said. \"Nobody wants to lose their parents this way.\"\nBut in the parents' final moments, Ceynowa said, Ron Tarnowski \"was doing what he's done for years: trying to help his wife and take care of her.\"\nKarl Tarnowski does not know what prompted his parents to drive so far away, but he suspects his father's dementia played a role. His father rarely visited the hunting cabin in recent years, and he never traveled there without one of his two sons. Even then, he would be on edge, wanting to hurry home before sundown to take care of his wife.\nThe morning before they went missing, \"everything seemed totally normal,\" Karl Tarnowski said. His wife gave his mother a bath and cooked the couple some breakfast. Later that morning, he left town for the day, telling his father, \"See you later, Papa.\"\n\"He said, 'Take your time, but hurry back,'\" Tarnowski said. \"He said, \"We'll be here anyway. We never go anywhere.\"\nEvidence uncovered during the course of the seven-day search revealed some details about the rest of their day. The couple stopped by a local Wells Fargo Bank, where Ron Tarnowski withdrew an amount of cash typical for him. Then they stopped at a restaurant for lunch, Karl Tarnowski said.\nThe map shows the distance from Ron and Mary Tarnowski's home to where their bodies were found. (Google Maps)\nAt some point afterward, they headed northwest on Highway 2 toward their hunting property. It was a \"beautiful\" summer day, Ceynowa said, \"a day we all hope for in the north.\"\nA video from security cameras showed the couple in one of their final moments, walking through a bar and grill in Brookston, Minn., possibly hours before their vehicle got stuck.\nThe surveillance footage captured the extent of the couple's immobility. They could be seen slowly walking into the restaurant. Ron Tarnowski led the way, trudging along with his cane and holding his wife's hand as she walked behind him, dragging a leg. It took 16 minutes for the couple to take a bathroom break, Karl Tarnowski said.\nThey had been married for 59 years.\nLately, caring for his wife had became a taxing responsibility for Ron Tarnowski. And in recent years, his mental deterioration became a challenge for his wife, their son said.\nBut throughout these tribulations, Karl Tarnowski said, \"their love was outstanding for one another.\"\nRon Tarnowski joined the Air Force before graduating from high school and was stationed in the Philippines for a long time, his son said. He actively volunteered with the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal organization. As a father, he could be a \"kind of harsh person\" at times, but he had a \"heart of gold,\" Karl Tarnowski said.\nHis father often offered to work on welding projects for neighbors and friends, and would always say \"this weld is guaranteed,\" Tarnowski recounted. \"If it breaks, I'll weld it again.\"\nMary Tarnowski was a \"big-hearted\" mother who \"loved people\" and always looked forward to playing cards with friends. Before her stroke, she volunteered with the census every 10 years, participated in her children's parent-teacher associations and made sure everything in the home was organized. She never had a driver's license, so her husband would frequently drive her around town.\n\"They went everywhere together,\" said Mark Lavalier, a retired firefighter who worked with Ron Tarnowski for several years and who assisted with the search efforts. \"You'd never see one without the other.\"\nThe story of the missing couple resonated with families across the state, particularly those with elderly parents, Lavalier said.\n\"Everybody's got parents. Everybody watches them get old and realizes they become vulnerable,\" Lavalier said. \"That's what people reacted to. This could be my parents. This could be everybody's parents.\"\nThe story of the Tarnowskis also underscored the dangers vulnerable adults can face when they leave home with no way of being reached or tracked. The OnStar device on the Chevy Tahoe was not activated, and neither Tarnowski was accustomed to carrying and using a cellphone.\nKarl Tarnowski urged the importance of making sure vulnerable adults carry GPS tracking devices or cellphones at all times.\n\"If there's any positive outcome to this,\" he said, it's that, perhaps, \"it's going to help somebody else find their parents someday.\"\nMore from Morning Mix\nBoy Scouts' sailing lesson turns deadly when mast strikes power lines on Texas lake\nTed Bradford was exonerated for a 1996 rape.

", " A U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Air and Marine Operations helicopter crew discovered the elderly Duluth couple's vehicle in a remote location at about 3:45 p.m. Saturday, according to the Duluth Police Department. The investigation into the deaths was ongoing Saturday night, but foul play wasn't suspected. It appeared the couple's SUV had gotten stuck, police said.\nThey were found about a mile from the family's hunting camp, according to a statement posted on the \"Find Ron and Mary Tarnowski\" Facebook page that family members had started to aid the search. The camp is near U.S. Highway 2 between Brookston and Floodwood, and a few miles from where the couple had been last seen, the Country Corner store.\n\"The family would like to thank the many men and women of law enforcement, the active and retired firefighters, the Alzheimer's Association, and the overwhelming support of the community and the media for the diligent efforts this past week,\" the Facebook statement read.\nAircraft involved in the search had been grounded Friday because of thunderstorms in the region, officials said, but returned to the air on Saturday.\nThe news prompted an outpouring of condolences and support on social media for the Tarnowski family - including the couple's sons, Kurt and Karl, and Karl's wife Bev - who had been tireless in recent days in organizing search efforts and checking on possible sightings.\nRon, 82, and Mary, 78, had been last seen July 29 at the Country Corner store along Highway 2. Ron was in the early stages of dementia, and Mary suffered from right-side paralysis and had difficulty speaking. They lived in a home Karl Tarnowski built for his parents, adjacent to his own home in Duluth. They generally spent most of their time at home, going out only for an occasional meal at nearby restaurants.\nThey weren't carrying cellphones or credit cards when they went missing, and an OnStar system in their vehicle was not activated, which left authorities with few clues to pinpoint a search over the past week.\n\"We're not looking for a needle in a haystack, because we haven't found the haystack yet,\" Duluth Police Chief Mike Tusken said at a Saturday morning gathering at the Tarnowskis' home.\nMore than 100 volunteers, some wearing purple T-shirts and ribbons for Alzheimer's awareness, gathered in Ron and Mary's driveway to begin another day of searching for the couple Saturday. A photo of Ron and Mary was taped to their garage with a sign above it: \"Missing 8 days.\"\nAbout 20 current and retired Duluth firefighters were among the crowd of volunteers to search for one of their own. Ron was a Duluth firefighter for 31 years.\nRetired Duluth firefighters Jim Reed and Mark Lavalier had already been out searching in the past week. Lavalier worked with Ron and lives one block south of the Tarnowskis. Trying to hold back tears on Saturday morning, before the couple was found, he said, \"If it was me, I know that they'd be there for me.\"\nReed didn't know Ron well, but said \"nobody deserves this, to be lost\" and to be confused with dementia.\nLaw enforcement's efforts to find the Tarnowskis ramped up on Saturday with a new emergency command center set up in Pike Lake and a new tip line with two dispatchers dedicated to the case.\nDuring the Saturday morning gathering, Tusken said the police department's violent crimes unit, which handles missing person cases, had been working on the case since Day One and had tracked down dozens of leads in six counties and two states.\nThe police department decided to change tactics on Friday night due to the expanding search for the couple, and the command center created a centralized location for the various agencies assisting in the search.\nAt the command center on Saturday, before the Tarnowskis were found, there was a steady stream of phone calls with tips and search updates.\nLaw enforcement officials studied a gas station's surveillance video, cross-referencing it with Google Maps and a tip to determine the likelihood that Ron and Mary's vehicle might have been captured on the video.\nOn the wall, areas already searched were being marked on a large map of Northeastern Minnesota. Authorities had notified FedEx, UPS and rural mail carriers to keep an eye out, and some student pilots had flown over the region to search while getting in their practice hours.\nReed, the retired Duluth firefighter who had gathered with dozens of other volunteers Saturday morning at the Tarnowskis' home, said at that time that the community response \"is a big circle. Hopefully somebody will do it for us or one of our loved ones if it happened to them. That's how we do it. We live in a society where we all got to help each other out.\"\nAndrew Krueger of the News Tribune staff contributed to this report."], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets":

And while a month off the booze sounds like a seductive way to make up for all that hard-drinking festive excess, it's actually a terrible idea, rooted in guilt rather than science. And for some people who actually have a real problem with alcohol, successfully completing a \"sober January\" can give the dangerous illusion that they don't have a problem.\nI should know. I was one of them. I speak not only as a veteran of many a sober January, but also as someone who was finally forced to admit that yes, they were an alcoholic, and had to stop drinking entirely. I have not had a drink for several years now. I don't say this to boast, merely to put in context what follows.\nI remember one hungover December morning telling a colleague at the magazine where I was working at the time that I was planning to stay off the drink for a month in the new year.\n\"Why on earth would you do that?\" he replied. \"A few drinks are the only thing that get you through January, it's so bloody miserable.\"\nHe wasn't an addict, so he didn't understand the allure of a sober January to someone who was - that the idea of getting obliterated over Christmas and New Year and then \"white-knuckling\" it for a month before picking up where you left off is deeply appealing to the classic all-or-nothing, getting-away-with-it mentality of the addict.\nI managed several sober Januarys and they became an important weapon in my armoury of denial. Me, an alcoholic? Hardly! How could I manage to stay off drink for a month if I was?\nI find it particularly depressing that this year, the idea of a dry January is being promoted by the UK's biggest alcohol charity, the always well-intentioned Alcohol Concern. Although the charity is careful to state in small print at the bottom of its webpage that the challenge should \"not be attempted by people with an alcohol dependency problem\" unfortunately those are exactly the kind of people a promotion like this will attract. Year after year, the only mates that I could persuade to do a sober January with me were the ones who were as bad as or worse than me. The normals, like my co-worker, were never interested. Why would they be?\nIf you are worried about the amount you have been drinking, the answer is not to swear off drink for a month. The answer is to try and establish whether you do really have a problem. And the best way to do that, ironically enough, is to do some drinking.\nThis was the course of action recommended by Bill Wilson, the co-founder of the self-help movement Alcoholics Anonymous. Wilson believed that alcoholics suffer a kind of allergic reaction to alcohol, and that once they start drinking they develop an overwhelming craving for more. This craving, he thought, is only made worse by subsequent attempts to satisfy it with more drink, like an itch that gets worse the more you scratch it.\nWilson's alcoholism test is remarkably simple, and does not involve any boxes to tick or medical examinations or liver function tests; it just requires a modicum of honesty.\n\"We do not like to pronounce any individual as alcoholic, but you can quickly diagnose yourself,\" he wrote. \"Step over to the nearest barroom and try some controlled drinking. Try to drink and stop abruptly. Try more than once. It will not take long for you to decide, if you are honest with yourself about it.\"\nSo - unless your sole aim is to save cash - don't challenge yourself to a sober January. Anyone can do that. Try having a pint every night - but just one - if you really want to prove you don't have a problem.\nAs my friend said all those years ago, January sucks - just look at the weather outside - and you normals should have all the help you can to get through it.

But if you actually are a \"normal,\" it turns out there might be some merit in the month-long detox. The staff at the New Scientist ran a small-scale test on themselves, and got some pretty astonishing results. Ten staffers laid off booze for five weeks, and saw their liver fat, blood glucose, and blood cholesterol levels all fall significantly-reducing their risk for liver disease, diabetes, and heart disease-while four staffers who kept drinking saw no changes. But it was a fairly limited experiment, offering no clue how long those effects will last. Heather Timmons at Quartz argues that such \"detoxes\" are \"useless\" in the long-term, since the body regularly clears out toxins all on its own. So instead, she recommends taking two or three consecutive days off from drinking each week, since it takes the liver a full day to recover from heavy drinking-plus, over the course of a year, that ensures as many as 150 alcohol-free days."}, "test66": {"documents": ["VATICAN CITY (AP) - The Vatican says Pope Francis was \"shocked and profoundly saddened\" by a murderous attack at a home for the elderly in southern Yemen that killed 16 people, including four nuns.\nThe Vatican secretary of state said in a condolence message on Saturday that the pontiff \"prays that this pointless slaughter will awaken consciences, lead to a change of heart, and inspire all parties to lay down their arms.\"\nOfficials and witnesses in Yemen said gunmen on Friday stormed a retirement home run by a charity established by Mother Teresa, moving room to room handcuffing the victims before shooting them in the head.\nThe pope sent prayers for the dead and expressed his spiritual closeness to those affected by this \"this act of senseless and diabolical violence.\" ", " Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's David Campanale says the attack is being blamed on IS\nPope Francis has condemned the killing of 16 people, including four Catholic nuns, at an old people's home in Yemen.\nHe called Friday's gun attack in Aden an \"act of senseless and diabolical violence\".\nReports said the attackers pretended they were visiting their mothers to gain access to the home.\nNo group has claimed responsibility for the attack, though Yemeni officials have blamed so-called Islamic State.\nIn a statement, the Vatican said two of the nuns killed were Rwandan, one was Indian and one was from Kenya.\n'Pointless slaughter'\nThey were working as nurses at the home and had been serving breakfast to its 80 residents when the attack occurred.\nAll the victims were shot in the head and had been handcuffed, the Associated Press reported, citing the brother of a victim.\nThe nuns were from the Missionaries of Charity congregation, which runs the home and was founded in Calcutta by Mother Teresa.\nPope Francis \"prays that this pointless slaughter will awaken consciences, lead to a change of heart, and inspire all parties to lay down their arms and take up the path of dialogue\", Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin said.\n\"He sends the assurance of his prayers for the dead and his spiritual closeness to their families and to all affected from this act of senseless and diabolical violence.\"\nImage copyright EPA Image caption The care home looks after some 80 elderly people\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Breakfast was being served when the attack occurred\nMissionaries of Charity spokeswoman Sunita Kumar said members were \"absolutely stunned\" by the killings.\nThe nun in charge managed to hide and escaped unharmed.\nYemen is engulfed in a brutal civil war between Iran-backed Zaidi Shia Houthi rebels in the north and the Saudi-Arabia backed government in the south.\nIslamic State and Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) have both taken advantage of the war to gain ground in the country.\nMore than 6,000 people have been killed and 2.4 million people displaced in Yemen's war, the UN says.\nForces loyal to the government and southern militias regained control of Aden in July, aided by Saudi-led coalition air strikes and troops.

An extensive analysis of recent data showed that one in every seven colorectal cancer patients was younger than 50. The University of Michigan study raises questions about the current guidelines to begin screening at age 50.\nSigns of colorectal cancer, often called the \"symptomless cancer,\" include anemia, a dramatic change in the size or frequency of bowel movements, and dark blood or blood mixed with stool, (sometimes appearing as black threads), in bowel movements. Because these symptoms may be nonexistent, mild, or infrequent, many people are not aware of their condition until their malignancy becomes advanced and spreads into the lymph nodes. A colonoscopy is the usual screening test, but stool tests are also effective for some people. If you are worried, you can request your primary care physician provide you with one of these simple stool tests, no matter your age.\nYounger Patients Increasing\nSeeing a recent rise in cancer cases among younger people, a team led by Dr. Samantha Hendren conducted a study of the nationally representative Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Insitute to assess age and treatment patterns among colorectal patients. Specifically, they gathered and analyzed data from patients diagnosed in the United States between 1998 and 2011. Their results point to important changes.\nOf more than 258,000 total colorectal cancer patients, 37,847 (about 15 percent) were younger than 50. These younger-than-expected patients were more likely to be diagnosed with either regional or distant malignancies, both of which are more dangerous than localized tumors.\nIn terms of treatment, younger patients suffering with a distant metastasis - where the cancer has spread from an original tumor - were more likely to undergo surgery than older patients; 72 percent versus 63 percent. Radiation therapy was more likely to be used with younger rectal cancer patients than in older patients; 53 percent versus 48 percent.\nBy various measures, younger patients saw more positive results. Despite the tendency to have more advanced disease when diagnosed, younger-than-50 colorectal cancer patients overall lived slightly longer without a cancer recurrence. With regard to localized disease, the five-year survival rate was 95.1 percent for younger patients versus 91.9 percent for older patients, with regard to regional disease, 76 percent versus 70.3 percent, and with regard to distant disease 21.3 percent versus 14.1 percent.\n\"These findings suggest the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults,\" wrote the researchers in the study. They believe their work is a wake-up call to the medical community, which should be looking for the signs of colorectal cancer in patients younger than 50.\nIf age 50 is maintained as the recommended time to begin screening, this study suggests that nearly 15 percent of all patients may be caught late in the process of disease. By comparison, breast cancer screening is recommended to begin at age 40. Less than 5 percent of invasive breast cancers occur in women under that age.\nSource: Abdelsattar Z, Wong S, Regenbogen S, et al. Colorectal Cancer Outcomes and Treatment Patterns in Patients Too Young for Average-Risk Screening. CANCER. 2016. ", " (Reuters Health) - One in seven colon and rectal cancers in the U.S. are now diagnosed in patients younger than age 50, which is when people are advised to begin routine screenings for these tumors, a new study finds.\nBy 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in 10 colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50, researchers estimate in the journal Cancer.\n\"Colorectal cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly; this study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colorectal cancers are occurring in young people,\" said senior study author Dr. Samantha Hendren of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\nResearchers analyzed cancer registry data from 1998 to 2011 for about 258,000 patients with colorectal tumors and found that 37,847 of them, or almost 15 percent, were diagnosed before age 50.\nCompared with older patients, those under 50 were 30 percent more likely to be diagnosed with tumors that had spread to the lymph nodes and 50 percent more likely to have cancer that had advanced to other organs, the study found.\nYounger patients with tumors that had metastasized, or reached other organs, were also more likely than older people to get more aggressive treatments.\nAbout 72 percent of people under 50 got surgery, compared with 63 percent of older individuals. And while 53 percent of younger patients received radiation, just 48 percent of older people did.\nEven though patients diagnosed younger tended to have more aggressive disease, they also lived slightly longer without tumors returning after their initial course of treatment.\nFive-year survival odds were about 95 percent for patients under 50 diagnosed with local tumors that hadn't spread yet, compared to roughly 92 percent for older people.\nWith tumors that spread to the lymph nodes, five-year survival rates were 76 percent for young people and 70 percent for older patients, while with cancers that metastasized to other organs the survival odds were 21 percent versus 14 percent, respectively.\nOne shortcoming of the study is that researchers lacked data on family history and other risk factors for colorectal cancers, the authors note. It's also possible that treatment choices and overall survival were influenced by what's known as selection bias, when healthier people may get more interventions and have better outcomes.\nOften, patients may get an early warning of colorectal tumors with symptoms such as bleeding, changes in bowel habits or pain when going to the bathroom that can point to the need for diagnostic screening, said Dr. Joel Randolph Hecht, director of the gastrointestinal oncology program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles.\n\"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" Hecht, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.\nThere are guidelines for screening some people starting at age 40 if they have a family history of colorectal cancer, noted Dr. Sidney Winawer of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.\n\"Without a family history, physicians need to use their judgment when seeing young people who have bowel symptoms and refer those of concern to a gastroenterologist for a diagnostic workup, \" Winawer, who wasn't involved in the study, added by email. \"This is difficult since we do not wish to expose young people to unnecessary tests.\"\nIt isn't clear from the study findings, however, whether changing preventive screening guidelines to start at a younger age would ultimately prevent more cancer deaths, said Dr. David Weinberg, chairman of medicine at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia.\n\"If the goal of screening is disease prevention, as it generally is for colorectal cancer, it is not clear when screening should start,\" Weinberg, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. \"Too early and the yield of screening will be very low since young people are still less likely to get colorectal cancer than older people.\"\nSOURCE: bit.ly/23o5QvC Cancer, online January 25, 2016. ", " MONDAY, Jan. 25, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Colon cancer rates are rising among men and women under 50, the age at which guidelines recommend screenings start, a new analysis shows. One in seven colon cancer patients is under 50. Younger patients are more likely to have advanced stage cancer, but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence because they are treated aggressively, the researchers reported. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" said study lead author Dr. Samantha Hendren, an associate professor of surgery at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50,\" she added.\nHowever, Hendren said it's too soon to say whether colon cancer screening guidelines should be altered to reflect that trend.\nIn the analysis, colon cancer among younger patients was often found at an advanced stage, meaning the disease has spread to lymph nodes or other organs. \"Part of the reason for this is that these young patients are often diagnosed only after their cancers start to cause symptoms, such as anemia, bowel bleeding or a blockage in the colon,\" Hendren explained.\nDoctors should be on the lookout for these warning signs of colon cancer, she added.\nNot all bowel bleeding is caused by cancer, she said. \"Bright red bleeding with a bowel movement is usually due to hemorrhoids or fissures, but dark blood or blood mixed with the stool is a warning sign,\" Hendren said.\nPeople with a family history of colon cancer and others who are at higher risk should begin screening earlier than the age of 50, she said. \"This is already recommended, but we don't think this is happening consistently, and this is something we need to optimize,\" she added.\nThe report was published online Jan. 25 in the journal Cancer.\nDr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the reasons for the increase in colon cancer among younger adults isn't known.\n\"It is unexplained,\" he said. \"It's not simply a change in diagnoses, it's a very real increase. There may be an effect of our environment that could be contributing to the increase.\"\nSmoking, obesity and physical inactivity are all risk factors for colon cancer, as is a poor diet, Chan said. \"When we are faced with patients who have many of these elements, we should think more about the potential of them developing colon cancer at an earlier age,\" he said.\nFor the study, Hendren and her colleagues culled federal government data on nearly 260,000 patients diagnosed with colon cancer between 1998 and 2011.\nOf these patients, nearly 15 percent were younger than 50. These patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer and more likely to have surgery than older patients (72 percent versus 63 percent). Radiation therapy was also used more often in younger patients than in older patients (53 percent versus 48 percent), the researchers found.\nYounger patients lived a little longer without a cancer recurrence, even though they tended to have more advanced cancer, Hendren said.\nFor patients under 50, about 68 percent survived five years, while about 67 percent of the patients 50 and older survived five years, she said. \"It looks like patients' young age helps them in their cancer treatment and survival,\" she added.\nThese findings raise the question of whether screening for colon cancer should begin at an earlier age, Hendren said. \"This would be a big and costly change, and I don't know whether it would help more people than it would hurt, so a lot of research would be required to understand this before any changes should be made,\" she said.\nChan noted that although the incidence of colon cancer is increasing among people under 50, the risk is still low. \"I don't think the data at this point support expanding screening to younger age groups,\" he said.\nHendren said that \"the cancer community needs to prepare for the increasing number of very young colorectal cancer survivors who will need long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments.\"\nMore information\nVisit the U.S. National Cancer Institute

They just shot.\"\nLiang declined to comment when reached on his cellphone.\n\"This is a first step in getting justice for the reckless shooting and wrongful death of Akai Gurley,\" said Scott Rynecki, an attorney for Kimberly Ballinger, the domestic partner of the slain man.\nOfficers from Liang's unit had been told to focus on exterior patrols following a spate of shootings in the housing complex, so it was unclear why Liang was performing a vertical patrol.\nWeeks later, Gurley's mother, Sylvia Palmer, said her son had been planning a surprise trip to visit her in Florida for Thanksgiving before he was killed.\n\"I pray to God that I get justice for my son,\" she said. \"Because my son didn't deserve to die like that.\"\nLiang is the second NYPD officer to be indicted in a week.\nOfficer Joel Edouard, 37, surrendered on Feb. 3 after he was caught on video stomping a marijuana suspect's head. He was indicted on charges of assault and official misconduct.\n\"I'm happy to see this indictment happen,\" said Kevin Powell, the spokesman for Gurley's family. \"It won't be full justice unless he's actually convicted of the killing of Akai Gurley. We've seen this before where officers are indicted but there's no conviction.\"\nMayor Bill de Blasio, who was blasted by police unions for statements he made in the wake of a Staten Island grand jury's decision not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo for Eric Garner's death, released a more subdued message Tuesday.\n\"It has been reported that a Brooklyn grand jury has acted in this case,\" the mayor said. \"No matter the specific charges, this case is an unspeakable tragedy for the Gurley family. We urge everyone to respect the judicial process as it unfolds.\"\nThe indictment was first reported by NY1.

", " Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\n\n\nThe Brooklyn district attorney said on Friday that he planned to impanel a grand jury to look into the death of Akai Gurley, an unarmed Brooklyn man who was killed last month by a police officer patrolling a public-housing unit.\nWith protests continuing over the grand jury decisions not to charge the officers who killed Eric Garner on Staten Island and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., the tension around the Gurley case has also risen. Mr. Gurley was black, as were Mr. Garner and Mr. Brown. The officers in the Garner and Brown cases are white; the officer who shot Mr. Gurley, Peter Liang, is Asian-American.\nThe district attorney, Kenneth P. Thompson, said in a statement that he did not support the appointment of an independent prosecutor to handle the case, saying he had been elected by Brooklyn's residents to represent their interests. \"It is important to get to the bottom of what happened,\" he said.\nMr. Thompson added, at an event on Friday, that prosecutors had not completed their investigation, so the timing for the grand jury was not yet clear.\nMr. Thompson has not said what charge or charges he might ask the grand jury to consider.\nMr. Gurley, 28, was killed Nov. 20 as he walked in a dark stairwell in the Louis H. Pink Houses in the East New York neighborhood, his girlfriend at his side. The elevators in the building often malfunctioned and residents often used the stairs instead, even though the lights in the stairwells were frequently out, as they were that night.\nOfficer Liang, 27, was conducting a so-called vertical patrol with his partner, starting on the roof and heading down through the stairwells, a common procedure for officers assigned to housing projects. Officer Liang had his gun out and opened the door to a stairwell; the gun went off, authorities said, as Mr. Gurley entered the stairwell one floor below.\nThe police commissioner, William J. Bratton, characterized the shooting as \"an unfortunate accident.\"\nWhile there were immediate calls for criminal charges for the officers who killed Mr. Garner and Mr. Brown, opinions about the Gurley case were varied. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who called for protests in the earlier cases, said he \"didn't know\" whether an indictment was appropriate for Officer Liang.\n\"There has to be a full investigation,\" Mr. Sharpton said, cautioning that supporters of the officer \"should not rush to judgment and say it is an accident when they don't know what happened.\"\nUnited States Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn, said Mr. Thompson's decision was \"a meaningful step in the right direction.\"\n\"Akai Gurley did not deserve to die,\" he said, \"and the evidence of a kill shot that penetrated his chest and struck him in the heart suggests something more than a noncriminal accident.\"\nA similar shooting occurred in January 2004, when Timothy Stansbury Jr., 19, was killed on a roof at the Louis Armstrong Houses in Brooklyn by Officer Richard S. Neri Jr. A grand jury declined to indict Officer Neri after he testified that he had unintentionally discharged his weapon after Mr. Stansbury pushed open a rooftop door, startling him.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\nGiven what is known about the Gurley case, said Delores Jones-Brown, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who directs its Center on Race, Crime and Justice, it seemed likely that a jury would consider criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment charges.\nA central question for the grand jury to consider, Professor Jones-Brown said, is \"what police are trained and authorized to do in these kinds of situations.\" If the police action goes against training and police guidelines, the next step would be to determine how much of the officer's behavior had diverged from \"the kind of care he should've been exercising,\" she said.\nThe investigation into the shooting so far has covered the first minutes after the officer shot Mr. Gurley, a law enforcement official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about an ongoing case. Mr. Liang may have used his phone to send a text message during that period, the source said, The Daily News reported on Friday.\nJames P. O'Neill, chief of department and the highest ranking uniformed officer in the Police Department, declined to comment on Officer Liang's actions.\n\"This is an ongoing investigation by our department and the Brooklyn district attorney's office,\" Chief O'Neill said. \"I really can't talk about it.\"\nThe Daily News suggested that Officer Liang was texting a representative of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, although a spokesman for the union said that account did \"not appear to be true.\" Nonetheless, one police official said, it was not unusual for an on-duty officer to seek guidance from a union representative after firing a gun.\nMr. Jeffries said that in the Gurley case, he hoped a grand jury would vote for an indictment.\n\"That doesn't necessarily mean a conviction, but it should mean an indictment that allows the facts to be aired in a public trial,\" he said. \"When unarmed black men are killed by police officers, we need public trials to help restore confidence in the criminal justice system.\""], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "0.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "0, 12;17, 43;53, 94", "docSpanText": "A rookie cop<SPAN_SEP>shot and killed an

Marcus Merritt, testified Wednesday that Holcomb addressed him with a racial slur and threatened to \"kill me and put me in a body bag and send me home.'' Merritt said he became suicidal after enduring punishment and humiliation from Holcomb.\nIn their opening statements, prosecutors had said testimony would show that soldiers taunted Chen with racial slurs, kicked him and pelted him with rocks in merciless hazing in the weeks before the private's suicide.\nHolcomb, 30, is the first to face court-martial in a case that has focused renewed attention on allegations of hazing and racism in the Army, where Asian Americans are a distinct minority. Courts-martial for the other seven soldiers, including an officer, are scheduled for later this year.\nMilitary prosecutors elicited the testimony in the second day of the proceedings to buttress charges that Holcomb hazed and hounded Chen, a Chinese American, into committing suicide at a remote combat outpost in Afghanistan on Oct. 3. Holcomb, one of eight soldiers charged in connection with Chen's death, faces charges of negligent homicide, assault, reckless endangerment and other counts.\nFT. BRAGG, N.C. -- Sgt. Adam Holcomb bombarded Danny Chen, a shy, 19-year-old Army private, with racial slurs and bloodied Chen's back by dragging him across rocky ground for disobeying a platoon rule, several former members of Holcomb's platoon testified at his court-martial Wednesday.\nU.S. Army Sgt. Adam Holcomb, right, is the first of eight men facing prosecution... (Raul R. Rubiera, The Fayetteville...)\n\"He was in my face constantly,'' Merritt testified when asked why he had contemplated suicide. \"All the stuff he did had a long-lasting effect on me.''\nUnder cross-examination, Merritt conceded that he knew Holcomb wasn't serious about killing him. But he also said he feared the sergeant, telling a military psychiatrist he wanted to kill Holcomb.\nHolcomb's immediate superior, Staff Sgt. Darren Holt, told the military panel of 10 officers and non-commissioned officers that he confronted Holcomb after the sergeant dragged Chen across sharp, baseball-sized rocks in late September. Holcomb was angry that Chen had ignored posted rules to turn off power to a water heater after taking a shower.\nHolt said he told Holcomb that physically abusing a soldier was wrong and reported the incident to superiors. \"I verbally counseled him [Holcomb] . . . and made it clear that was unacceptable,'' Holt said.\nChen shot himself under the chin in a base guard tower a week after the dragging incident, according to the Army.\nChen's death outraged some Chinese American activists in New York City's Chinatown, where Chen grew up with his immigrant parents. Several activists are attending the court-martial, along with journalists from China.\nHolcomb's military lawyers have said Chen killed himself because his parents had disowned him for joining the Army instead of attending college. They have portrayed Chen as an incompetent soldier who endangered his platoon and required constant discipline for such violations as sleeping on guard duty or reporting for his guard post without his helmet.\nDefense lawyers have also said that nicknames -- even those with racially tinged overtones -- were common \"terms of endearment'' in the small, tight-knit platoon. One African American platoon member, they said, encouraged soldiers to call him \"Black Mamba.''\nUnder cross-examination by the defense, former members of the platoon conceded that most discipline meted out by Holcomb was justified by Chen's failure to follow orders or regulations. Such \"corrective training,'' especially in combat zones, is an accepted way to improve soldiers' performance, according to testimony.\nSeveral soldiers testified that Chen never gave any overt indication that he was contemplating suicide. The platoon medic, Spec. Zachary Bolin, who treated Chen's back abrasions at Holcomb's request, said Chen denied suicidal thoughts when Bolin asked him about it.

The soldier from the 2nd Platoon, C Company, 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment tells the newspaper that although epithets were never hurled his way, he was told upon arrival that the special day was a \"tradition\" in which soldiers \"can say any racist remark you want without any consequences.\" \"It's degrading to the soldiers,\" the staff sergeant says. \"We've had soldiers almost fight over the crap that's going on here.\" A junior enlisted soldier anonymously backs up the NCO's claim, telling the Times that \"you didn't have to participate, but they'd remind you.\" He recalls a Latino soldier being called a \"wetback\" and \"border jumper\" before almost getting into a scuffle when the others wouldn't stop. The Alaska unit is the same one in which 19-year-old Pvt. Danny Chen served before killing himself in 2011 after being deployed.

While those teams were composed of other star-level players such as Doug Collins, George McGinnis, Bobby Jones, Darryl Dawkins and Lloyd Free, to name a few, there was an ingredient missing. Billy Cunningham, who took over as head coach before the 1977-78 season, knew exactly what it was. \"What we needed was that physical presence,\" Cunningham said yesterday. \"As good as Darryl and Caldwell Jones were, they weren't able to take us to the next level. With Doc [Erving] and Bobby Jones and the others, we had great athletes. We needed exactly what we got.\"\nWhat the Sixers got in the summer of 1982 was Moses Malone, the player everyone thought could take the organization to the promised land. He delivered, carrying the team to its only title since the 1967 season. Though he promised to deliver the title in \"Fo', fo', fo' \" fashion, the team actually needed 13 games to garner the championship after a sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers in the championship series.\nMalone passed away yesterday morning in his sleep in Norfolk, Va., at the age of 60. Sadly, the two players from whom Malone took over the center position - Dawkins and Caldwell Jones - also died in the past year, from heart attacks.\nIn his first season with the Sixers, Malone won MVP honors by averaging 24.5 points and 15.3 rebounds during the regular season in which the team compiled a 65-17 record. In those 13 playoff games, in which the Sixers stomped their way to the championship in three series, Malone averaged 26 points and 15.8 rebounds, garnering Finals MVP.\n\"I was just with him and Darryl at the ceremony at the Wells Fargo Center when the team unveiled their new uniforms [in mid-June] and then had lunch with Moses and Bobby Jones a couple of weeks after that,\" Cunningham said. \"As always, he was so much fun to be around.\"\nWhen the name of Moses Malone comes up, it is usually followed by laughs and a story. John Nash, who was assistant general manager for the Sixers when Malone was acquired from the Houston Rockets, shared one yesterday.\n\"I could write a play about us acquiring Moses,\" said Nash. \"[Owner] Harold Katz called me on a Sunday and said he wanted to get it done. But he was in Las Vegas, [general manager] Pat Williams was in China with Julius on a goodwill tour for the NBA, Billy was in North Carolina on a golf trip and Moses was in Houston. Somehow, we got everyone together, except for Billy, at 7 o'clock that Tuesday night in the Grand Hyatt in New York. We waited for Billy for about 30-to-45 awkward minutes before he came into the room, with his golf clubs over his shoulder. When we asked what took him so long, he said the cab ride was too expensive from Newark Airport, so he took the train in.\n\"It took until 2:30 in the morning to iron things out, and about two weeks later the deal was finally officially done - though Moses decided to go on a radio station in Virginia the morning after we talked and announced he had signed with the Sixers. It was crazy.\"\nAt the time, the deal was the largest for a player in team sports. Malone's contract was for six years at $2.2 million a season. After he averaged 23.9 points and 13.4 rebounds in four seasons, the Sixers traded him and forward Terry Catledge to the Washington Bullets for Jeff Ruland in one of the most-hated deals in Philly sports history. He would return in 1993-94 and average 17.1 points and 13.2 rebounds at age 38 in his next-to-last season.\nBut few players in this city's sports history, maybe none, connected with the fans with their style of play the way Malone did. There was that ever-present scowl when he was on the court, soaked with sweat, and that jovial smile and large laugh when he was off it that drew so many to embrace him.\n\"When we got him, we knew all about him,\" said Maurice Cheeks, the starting point guard on that 1983 team. \"He was an MVP. He had great numbers. But we didn't know who he was. Well, it didn't take long for us to mesh with him on the court, and it certainly didn't take long to love him off of it, too.\n\"When I think of Moses, besides the numbers and the great player, he was a great person. I just think of that laugh. I can still hear it. He would still tease me about pancakes. We had a noon game one time in Milwaukee and Moses was a little late coming down from his room. He saw me eating pancakes and asked me for some. I said no and he couldn't believe it. He teased me for years about those pancakes. It breaks me down to think this has happened.\"\nIn that initial meeting in New York, Cunningham pulled Malone aside and let him know his expectations of the player who had won MVP honors in Houston the previous season by averaging 31.1 points and 14.7 rebounds.\n\"Before we signed, we went into a room and I asked if he could deal with what we want to do,\" Cunningham said. \"I said that we expected him to rebound defensively and get it out and let us run as much as we could, then we'd look for you inside. He said he was 100 percent on board.\n\"A lot of players were unsettled by the trades we made, popular guys like Darryl and Caldwell. But after two days in training camp with Moses, they understood. Moses' favorite player was Julius. He would just like to play, leave and not talk to anybody. His hero was Doc and he wanted to win it for him. Moses was the smartest player I've been around in my life. Moses knew every player, their strengths and weaknesses, everybody on the court. He was just a basketball junkie.\"\nMalone grew up in Petersburg, Va., and signed a contract with the ABA's Utah Stars following high school. He played two seasons in the ABA before bursting onto the scene in the NBA, where he played 19 seasons. He was a 12-time NBA All-Star, won three MVPs and led the league in rebounding six times. He averaged at least 20 points for 11 straight seasons, was named to the league's 50th anniversary all-time team in 1995 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame in 2001.\nSaid Sixers CEO Scott O'Neil in a statement: \"It is with a deep sense of sadness that the Sixers family mourns the sudden loss of Moses Malone.

But one critic has claimed Crowe's accent 'sounds like an Australian doing an impression of Jim Bowen off Bullseye', while another suggested he had 15 different accents.

Rodriguez to an information charging him with one count of transmitting and presenting unlawfully issued USPS money orders with intent to defraud the United States. Judge Rodriguez imposed the sentence today in Camden federal court.\nAccording to the documents filed in this case and statements made in court:\nBowen admitted that Marc Saunders, 40, of Sicklerville, New Jersey, a former employee at the USPS branch in New Lisbon, New Jersey, provided him with stolen money orders and told him to recruit others to cash them. Bowen admitted that he recruited individuals to cash the money orders and paid them a small fee, while keeping the rest of the money for Saunders and himself.\nIn addition to the prison term, Judge Rodriguez sentenced Bowen to three years of supervised release and ordered to pay restitution of $18,470.\nOn Dec. 12, 2017, Saunders pleaded guilty to his role in the scheme, including producing the money orders with a stolen imprinting machine and giving them to others to cash. His sentencing is scheduled for July 24, 2018.\nActing U.S. Attorney Carpenito credited special agents of the USPS, Office of the Inspector General, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Kenneth M.

(Photo: Jim Walsh/Staff photographer)\nA 13-page affidavit filed in federal court in Camden says a postmaster's errors set the stage for thefts that eventually reached some $100,000.\nIt says the manager of the New Lisbon post office in rural Pemberton Township failed to return a machine that printed money orders when the Postal Service introduced new technology in February 2013.\nThe postmaster, who was transferred to another office in June 2013, also neglected to destroy about 180 loose money orders that could be printed with the outdated machine, the affidavit says.\nSaunders began working more than a year later at the Pemberton office, where the printing machine - too big for the postmaster's safe - had been stored in a cabinet, according to the affidavit by David Bannon, a special agent with the Office of Inspector General at the Postal Service.\nMore: Florida man accused of altering $1 money orders, depositing them for more than $2K\nThe Postal Service began investigating in late 2015, after people started cashing stolen money orders at post offices in the Philadelphia area, the affidavit says.\nBannon said serial numbers on the money orders led him to the Pemberton Township office on rural Four Mile Road, where he learned the imprinting machine had vanished.\nAccording to the affidavit, Bannon then realized the stolen money orders carried ZIP codes - imprinted by the stolen machine - for post offices \"all over the United States.\"\nNone, however, were marked with New Lisbon's ZIP code.\nAs a result, Bannon suspected a postal employee had stolen the machine from New Lisbon and was repeatedly changing its ZIP code setting to divert attention from that branch.\nSocial media ties accomplices together\nMost of the money orders were cashed at post offices in the Philadelphia area, but 22 were passed in Knoxville, where Bowen allegedly recruited residents of homeless shelters to conduct the transactions.\nNine orders were cashed in post offices around York, Pennsylvania, and one in Jersey City.\nThe August 2017 affidavit noted about 50 money orders never surfaced - and the printing machine remained missing.\nInvestigators were able to identify lower-level participants, who cashed the money orders for a fee. They then linked their cellphones and Facebook pages to those used by Saunders and the middlemen, the affidavit says.\nMore: Mailman hoarded more than 17,000 pieces of mail, authorities say\nIt notes one alleged ring member, identified only as M.M., passed a stolen money order in September 2015 - and at the same time bought a legitimate order made out to Saunders, then a Mount Laurel resident.\nThe affidavit also notes the men shared family ties and childhood connections.\nIt says Bowen and Saunders are cousins, while Sutton told investigators he grew up in the same neighborhood as Bell, attended high school with Saunders, and used to play football with Bowen.\nThe affidavit also says Bannon received two faxed letters in June 2017 from Bowen and a payee that used language from the \"sovereign citizens\" movement to challenge his authority and that of the court system.\nBell was sentenced July 25, one day after Saunders received his probationary term. Bowen and Sutton were sentenced in June.\nAll of the men were sentenced by U.S. District Judge Joseph Rodriguez.\nFollow Jim Walsh on Twitter: @jimwalsh_cp\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2vGkHGX"], "salient_spans": [{"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1591, 1647;1653, 1657;1659, 1781;1783, 1852", "docSpanText": "The postmaster, who was transferred to another office in<SPAN_SEP>2013<SPAN_SEP>also neglected to destroy about 180 loose money orders that could be printed with the outdated machine, the affidavit says<SPAN_SEP>Saunders began working more than a year later at the Pemberton office"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "728, 750;764, 777;795, 837", "docSpanText": "the scheme's organizer<SPAN_SEP>Marc Saunders<SPAN_SEP>received a five-year probationary sentence"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "894, 952", "docSpanText": "Saunders was ordered to pay restitution of almost $100,000"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2931, 3133", "docSpanText": "Most of the money orders were cashed at post offices in the Philadelphia area, but 22 were passed in Knoxville, where Bowen allegedly recruited residents of homeless shelters to conduct the transactions"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "3049, 3133", "docSpanText": "Bowen allegedly recruited residents of homeless shelters to conduct the transactions"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "313, 463", "docSpanText": "A federal judge has sentenced the last of three accomplices to prison, ordering Anthony Bell, 39, of Philadelphia to spend a year and a day in custody"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "954, 1030", "docSpanText": "The middlemen also were ordered to make restitution - about $22,400 for Bell"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "515, 557;559, 561", "docSpanText": "prison terms of 20 months for Eugene Bowen<SPAN_SEP>36"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "954, 1005;1032, 1049", "docSpanText": "The middlemen also were ordered to make restitution<SPAN_SEP>$18,500 for Bowen"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "592, 624", "docSpanText": "nine months for Andre Sutton, 39"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "954, 1005;1054, 1071", "docSpanText": "The middlemen also were ordered to make restitution<SPAN_SEP>$4,700 for Sutton"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1591, 1781;1854, 1947;1949, 2067", "docSpanText": "The postmaster, who was transferred to another office in June 2013, also neglected to destroy about 180 loose money orders that could be printed with the outdated machine, the affidavit says<SPAN_SEP>where the printing machine - too big for the postmaster's safe - had been stored in a cabinet<SPAN_SEP>according to the affidavit by David Bannon, a special agent with the Office of Inspector General at the Postal Service"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1854, 1947", "docSpanText": "where the printing machine - too big for the postmaster's safe - had been stored in a cabinet"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2931, 3041", "docSpanText": "Most of the money orders were cashed at post offices in the Philadelphia area, but 22 were passed in Knoxville"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "2322, 2433;2435, 2487", "docSpanText": "Bannon said serial numbers on the money orders led him to the Pemberton Township office on rural Four Mile Road<SPAN_SEP>where he learned the imprinting machine had vanished"}, {"documentFile": "2.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "3340, 3429;3441, 3493", "docSpanText": "Investigators were able to identify lower-level participants, who cashed the money orders<SPAN_SEP>They then linked their cellphones and Facebook pages"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "678, 691;726, 727;735, 788", "docSpanText": "Marc Saunders<SPAN_SEP>a<SPAN_SEP>employee at the USPS branch in New Lisbon, New Jersey"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "678, 691;790, 798;808, 871", "docSpanText": "Marc Saunders<SPAN_SEP>provided<SPAN_SEP>stolen money orders and told him to recruit others to cash them"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "683, 691;832, 871;873, 878;896, 942", "docSpanText": "Saunders<SPAN_SEP>told him to recruit others to cash them<SPAN_SEP>Bowen<SPAN_SEP>recruited individuals to cash the money orders"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "40, 86;268, 280", "docSpanText": "man was sentenced today to 20 months in prison<SPAN_SEP>Eugene Bowen"}, {"documentFile": "1.txt", "docSpanOffsets": "1090, 1095;1137, 1174", "docSpanText": "Bowen<SPAN_SEP>ordered to pay restitution of $18,470"}], "summary": "A neglected printing machine and nearly 200 blank money-order forms caught the eye of Marc Saunders sometime after he started working at the Postal Service's New Lisbon, NJ, branch in 2014.

An affidavit filed in Camden federal court by David Bannan, a special agent for the USPS' Office of Inspector General, details how the New Lisbon branch phased out the old money-order machine in 2013. Because it couldn't fit inside the office safe, however, the New Lisbon postmaster placed it inside a cabinet; it remained there when she moved to another branch later that year. The agent details his \"evidence pointing to an inside job,\" noting Saunders ran his scheme between August 2015 and December 2016. Most of the money orders were cashed in the Philly area, as well as in Knoxville, Tenn. Once the stolen money orders started to emerge, Bannan traced the serial numbers to the New Lisbon office, where the machine had gone missing.

", " Story highlights Pair are first North Korean athletes to qualify for 2018 Winter Olympics\nWinter Olympics will be held in South Korea from 9-25 February\n(CNN) In the small Bavarian ski-town of Oberstdorf, figure skaters Ryom Tae-Ok and Kim Ju-sik became the first North Korean athletes to qualify for South Korea's 2018 Winter Olympics -- a development that could have diplomatic implications as well as sporting ones.\nThe pair -- who perform to the music of The Beatles and have been training in Canada -- produced an impressive free-skate performance to secure one of the final Olympic spots up for grabs at the Nebelhorn Trophy in Germany in September.\nRyom, 18, and 25-year-old Kim finished 15th at the World Championships last season and spent the summer training in Montreal under French coach, Bruno Marcotte.\nTheir qualification will be welcome news to South Korea's President Moon Jae-in, who earlier this month told CNN that North Korean participation in PyeongChang will \"provide a very good opportunity for inter-Korean peace and reconciliation.\"\nRead More ", " The two nations have been on convivial sporting terms this year - North Korea sent its women's hockey team and a taekwondo team to compete in the South - but the Olympics have never gone forward free of geopolitics.\nNorth Korea boycotted the 1988 Summer Olympics held in Seoul, the South Korean capital. And North Korea's current leader, Kim Jong-un, is highly unpredictable.\nWhen the skaters were asked minutes after Friday's performance if they hoped to compete at the Games, their coach, Kim Hyon-son, stepped in and said, \"It is up to the North Korean Olympic Committee to decide whether they will participate or not.\"\nThe North Koreans appeared relaxed and open - to a point - at a second meeting with reporters after the competition here, the Nebelhorn Trophy, but requested that no questions be asked about the Olympics. Their reluctance probably stemmed from the fact that the decision will not be theirs, said Bruno Marcotte, a prominent French Canadian coach who also works with the skaters.\n\"It's out of their hands,\" he said.\nClearly, though, the outcome was important to North Korea. It has invested considerable time and money to make Ms. Ryom and Mr. Kim eligible for the Winter Games and respected at the international level. The skaters trained over the summer in Montreal with Mr. Marcotte, whose wife, Meagan Duhamel, is a two-time world pairs champion.

athletes to qualify for the 2018 Winter Olympics, which will be held just 40 miles south of the demilitarized zone in South Korea, CNN reports. According to the New York Times, 18-year-old Ryom Tae-Ok and 25-year-old Kim Ju-Sik, who have been training in Canada with a French coach, finished with a score of 180.09 at the Nebelhorn Trophy in Germany. It was a career-best performance in an international competition for the pair. Kim says they were motivated by their coaches and the people cheering for them. Ryom agreed: \"There were many people of different nationalities and backgrounds cheering for us. The fact that we gave them some kind of joy, that was the best part in the performance.\" While Kim and Ryom's sixth place finish in Germany was enough to nab them one of the final spots in February's Olympics, it remains unclear if they'll actually compete, Reuters reports. The decision rests with the North Korea Olympic Committee. Both South Korea and the International Olympic Committee have been pushing for North Korean athletes to participate in the Games, hoping it will be a diplomatic balm for the countries. The IOC has been providing travel, equipment, and accommodation to North Korean athletes attempting to qualify (North Korean skiers and speed skaters still have a shot), and South Korea's president said North Korea will have as much time as possible to decide if it will participate. North Korea boycotted the 1988 Summer Olympics in South Korea, but it did send a women's hockey team and taekwondo team to competitions in South Korea this year."}}
